<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is hoped that the present volume will supply a want
that is really felt by students of philosophy in our universities—the
want of an English text-book on General
Metaphysics from the Scholastic standpoint. It is the
author's intention to supplement his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Science of Logic</span></span><a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> and
the present treatise on Ontology, by a volume on the
Theory of Knowledge. Hence no disquisitions on the
latter subject will be found in these pages: the Moderate
Realism of Aristotle and the Schoolmen is assumed
throughout.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the domain of Ontology there are many scholastic
theories and discussions which are commonly regarded
by non-scholastic writers as possessing nowadays for the
student of philosophy an interest that is merely historical.
This mistaken notion is probably due to the fact that few
if any serious attempts have yet been made to transpose
these questions from their medieval setting into the
language and context of contemporary philosophy. Perhaps
not a single one of these problems is really and in substance
alien to present-day speculations. The author has
endeavoured, by his treatment of such characteristically
<span class="tei tei-q">“medieval”</span> discussions as those on <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Potentia</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Actus</span></span>,
Essence and Existence, Individuation, the Theory of
Distinctions, Substance and Accident, Nature and Person,
Logical and Real Relations, Efficient and Final Causes,
to show that the issues involved are in every instance as
fully and keenly debated—in an altered setting and a new
terminology—by recent and living philosophers of every
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
school of thought as they were by St. Thomas and his
contemporaries in the golden age of medieval scholasticism.
And, as the purposes of a text-book demanded,
attention has been devoted to stating the problems clearly,
to showing the significance and bearings of discussions
and solutions, rather than to detailed analyses of arguments.
At the same time it is hoped that the treatment
is sufficiently full to be helpful even to advanced students
and to all who are interested in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Metaphysics of the
Schools”</span>. For the convenience of the reader the more
advanced portions are printed in smaller type.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The teaching of St. Thomas and the other great
Schoolmen of the Middle Ages forms the groundwork
of the book. This <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">corpus</span></span> of doctrine is scarcely yet
accessible outside its Latin sources. As typical of the
fuller scholastic text-books the excellent treatise of the
Spanish author, Urraburu,<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> has been most frequently
consulted. Much assistance has also been derived from
Kleutgen's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophie der Vorzeit</span></span>,<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> a monumental work
which ought to have been long since translated into
English. And finally, the excellent treatise in the
Louvain <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cours de Philosophie</span></span>, by the present Cardinal
Archbishop of Mechlin,<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> has been consulted with profit
and largely followed in many places. The writer freely
and gratefully acknowledges his indebtedness to these and
other authors quoted and referred to in the course of the
present volume.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Reason of Introductory Chapter.</span></span>—It is desirable that
at some stage in the course of his investigations the student of
philosophy should be invited to take a brief general survey of
the work in which he is engaged. This purpose will be served
by a chapter on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the general aim and scope of philosophy</span></em>, its distinctive
characteristics as compared with other lines of human
thought, and its relations to these latter. Such considerations
will at the same time help to define <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ontology</span></em>, thus introducing
the reader to the subject-matter of the present volume.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Philosophy: the Name and the Thing.</span></span>—In the fifth
book of Cicero's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tusculan Disputations</span></span> we read that the terms
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophus</span></span> and <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophia</span></span> were first employed by Pythagoras
who flourished in the sixth century before Christ, that this ancient
sage was modest enough to call himself not a <span class="tei tei-q">“wise man”</span> but a
<span class="tei tei-q">“lover of wisdom”</span> (φίλος, σοφία), and his calling not a profession
of wisdom but a search for wisdom. However, despite the
disclaimer, the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophy</span></em> soon came to signify <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wisdom</span></em>
simply, meaning by this the highest and most precious kind of
knowledge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now human knowledge has for its object everything that
falls in any way within human experience. It has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extensively</span></em> a
great variety in its subject-matter, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intensively</span></em> a great variety
in its degrees of depth and clearness and perfection. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Individual
facts</span></em> of the past, communicated by human testimony, form the
raw materials of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical</span></em> knowledge. Then there are all the
individual things and events that fall within one's own personal
experience. Moreover, by the study of human language (or
languages), of works of the human mind and products of human
genius and skill, we gain a knowledge of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">literature</span></em>, and of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arts</span></em>—the fine arts and the mechanical arts. But not merely do
we use our senses and memory thus to accumulate an unassorted
stock of informations about isolated facts: a miscellaneous mass
of mental furniture which constitutes the bulk of human knowledge
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">least developed</span></em> form—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cognitio </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">vulgaris,</span></span></span> the knowledge
of the comparatively uneducated and unreflecting classes of mankind.
We also use our reasoning faculty to reflect, compare,
classify these informations, to interpret them, to reason about
them, to infer from them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general truths</span></em> that embrace individual
things and events <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beyond our personal experience</span></em>; we try to
explain them by seeking out their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reasons</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causes</span></em>. This
mental activity gradually converts our knowledge into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scientific</span></em>
knowledge, and thus gives rise to those great groups of systematized
truths called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sciences</span></em>: as, for example, the physical
and mathematical sciences, the elements of which usually form
part of our early education. These sciences teach us a great
deal about ourselves and the universe in which we live. There is
no need to dwell on the precious services conferred upon mankind
by discoveries due to the progress of the various <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">special</span></em>
sciences: mathematics as applied to engineering of all sorts;
astronomy; the physical sciences of light, heat, sound, electricity,
magnetism, etc.; chemistry in all its branches; physiology and
anatomy as applied in medicine and surgery. All these undoubtedly
contribute much to man's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bodily</span></em> well-being. But
man has a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mind</span></em> as well as a body, and he is moreover a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">social</span></em>
being: there are, therefore, other special sciences—<span class="tei tei-q">“human”</span> as
distinct from <span class="tei tei-q">“physical”</span> sciences—in which man himself is
studied in his mental activities and social relations with his
fellow-men: the sciences of social and political economy, constitutional
and civil law, government, statesmanship, etc. Furthermore,
man is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em> being, recognizing distinctions of good and
bad, right and wrong, pleasure and happiness, duty and responsibility,
in his own conduct; and finally he is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">religious</span></em> being,
face to face with the fact that men universally entertain views,
beliefs, convictions of some sort or other, regarding man's subjection
to, and dependence on, some higher power or powers
dwelling somehow or somewhere within or above the whole
universe of his direct and immediate experience: there are therefore
also sciences which deal with these domains, morality and
religion. Here, however, the domains are so extensive, and the
problems raised by their phenomena are of such far-reaching
importance, that the sciences which deal with them can hardly be
called special sciences, but rather constituent portions of the one
wider and deeper <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general</span></em> science which is what men commonly

The distinction between the special sciences on the one hand
and philosophy, the general science, on the other, will help us to
realize more clearly the nature and scope of the latter. The
special sciences are concerned with discovering the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proximate</span></em>
reasons and causes of this, that, and the other definite department
in the whole universe of our experience. The subject-matter of
some of them is totally different from that of others: physiology
studies the functions of living organisms; geology studies the
formation of the earth's crust. Or if two or more of them investigate
the same subject-matter they do so from different standpoints,
as when the zoologist and the physiologist study the
same type or specimen in the animal kingdom. But the common
feature of all is this, that each seeks only the reasons, causes, and
laws which give a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proximate</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">partial</span></em> explanation of the facts
which it investigates, leaving untouched and unsolved a number
of deeper and wider questions which may be raised about the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whence</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whither</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em>, not only of the facts themselves,
but of the reasons, causes and laws assigned by the particular
science in explanation of these facts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now it is those deeper and wider questions, which can be
answered only by the discovery of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more remote</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ultimate</span></em>
reasons and causes of things, that philosophy undertakes to investigate,
and—as far as lies within man's power—to answer.
No one has ever disputed the supreme importance of such inquiries
into the ultimate reasons and causes of things—into such
questions as these, for instance: What is the nature of man himself?
Has he in him a principle of life which is spiritual and
immortal? What was his first origin on the earth? Whence
did he come? Has his existence any purpose, and if so, what?
Whither does he tend? What is his destiny? Why does he
distinguish between a right and a wrong in human conduct?
What is the ultimate reason or ground of this distinction? Why
have men generally some form or other of religion? Why do
men generally believe in God? Is there really a God? What
is the origin of the whole universe of man's experience? Of life
in all its manifestations? Has the universe any intelligible or
intelligent purpose, and if so, what? Can the human mind give
a certain answer to any of these or similar questions? What
about the nature and value of human <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> itself? What is
its scope and what are its limitations? And since vast multitudes
of men <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">believe</span></em> that the human race has been specially
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enlightened by God Himself, by Divine Revelation, to know for
certain what man's destiny is, and is specially aided by God
Himself, by Divine Grace, to work out this destiny—the question
immediately arises: What are the real relations between reason
alone on the one hand and reason enlightened by such Revelation
on the other, in other words between natural knowledge and
supernatural faith?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now it will be admitted that the special sciences take us
some distance along the road towards an answer to such questions,
inasmuch as the truths established by these sciences, and even
the wider hypotheses conceived though not strictly verified in
them, furnish us with most valuable data in our investigation of
those questions. Similarly the alleged fact of a Divine Revelation
cannot be ignored by any man desirous of using all the data
available as helps towards their solution. The Revelation embodied
in Christianity claims not merely to enlighten us in regard
to many ultimate questions which mankind would be able to
answer without its assistance, but also to tell us about our destiny
some truths of supreme import, which of ourselves we should
never have been able to discover. It is obvious, then, that
whether a man has been brought up from his infancy to believe
in the Christian Revelation or not, his whole outlook on life will
be determined very largely by his belief or disbelief in its authenticity
and its contents. Similarly, if he be a Confucian, or a
Buddhist, or a Mohammedan, his outlook will be in part determined
by what he believes of their teachings. Man's conduct
in life has undoubtedly many determining influences, but it will
hardly be denied that among them the predominant influence is
exerted by the views that he holds, the things he believes to be
true, concerning his own origin, nature and destiny, as well as the
origin, nature and destiny of the universe in which he finds himself.
The Germans have an expressive term for that which, in
the absence of a more appropriate term, we may translate as a
man's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">world-outlook</span></em>; they call it his <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Weltanschauung</span></span>. Now this
world-outlook is formed by each individual for himself from his
interpretation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his experience as a whole</span></em>. It is not unusual to
call this world-outlook a man's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophy of life</span></em>. If we use the
term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophy</span></em> in this wide sense it obviously includes whatever
light a man may gather from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">special sciences</span></em>, and whatever
light he may gather from a divinely revealed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">religion</span></em> if he believes
in such, as well as the light his own reason may shed upon a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
special and direct study of those ultimate questions themselves,
to which we have just referred. But we mention this wide sense
of the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophy</span></em> merely to put it aside; and to state that
we use the term in the sense more commonly accepted nowadays,
the sense in which it is understood to be distinct from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">special
sciences</span></em> on the one side and from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supernatural theology</span></em> or the
systematic study of divinely revealed religion on the other.
Philosophy is distinct from the special sciences because while the
latter seek the proximate, the former seeks the ultimate grounds,
reasons and causes of all the facts of human experience. Philosophy
is distinct from supernatural theology because while the
former uses <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the unaided power of human reason</span></em> to study the ultimate
questions raised by human experience, the latter uses <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason
enlightened by Divine Revelation</span></em> to study the contents of this
Revelation in all their bearings on man's life and destiny.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence we arrive at this simple and widely accepted definition
of philosophy: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the science of all things through their ultimate
reasons and causes as discovered by the unaided light of human
reason</span></em>.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> The first part of this definition marks off philosophy
from the special sciences, the second part marks it off from supernatural
theology.

We must remember, however, that these three departments of knowledge—scientific,
philosophical, and revealed—are not isolated from one
another in any man's mind; they overlap in their subject-matter, and though
differing in their respective standpoints they permeate one another through
and through. The separation of the special sciences from philosophy,
though adumbrated in the speculations of ancient times and made more
definite in the middle ages, was completed only in modern times through the
growth and progress of the special sciences themselves. The line of demarcation
between philosophy and supernatural theology must be determined by
the proper relations between Reason and Faith: and naturally these relations
are a subject of debate between philosophers who believe in the
existence of an authentic Divine Revelation and philosophers who do not.
It is the duty of the philosopher as such to determine by the light of reason
whether a Supreme Being exists and whether a Divine Revelation to man is
possible. If he convinces himself of the existence of God he will have little
difficulty in inferring the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">possibility</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of a Divine Revelation. The </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">fact</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of a
Divine Revelation is a matter not for philosophical but for historical research.
Now when a man has convinced himself of the existence of God and the
fact of a Divine Revelation—the </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">preambula fidei</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> or prerequisite conditions of
Faith, as they are called—he must see that it is eminently reasonable for him
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
to believe in the contents of such Divine Revelation; he must see that the
truths revealed by God cannot possibly trammel the freedom of his own
reason in its philosophical inquiries into ultimate problems concerning man
and the universe; he must see that these truths may possibly act as beacons
which will keep him from going astray in his own investigations: knowing
that truth cannot contradict truth he knows that if he reaches a conclusion
really incompatible with any certainly revealed truth, such conclusion must
be erroneous; and so he is obliged to reconsider the reasoning processes
that led him to such a conclusion.</span><a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> Thus, the position of the Christian
philosopher, aided in this negative way by the truths of an authentic Divine
Revelation, has a distinct advantage over that of the philosopher who does
not believe in such revelation and who tries to solve all ultimate questions
independently of any light such revelation may shed upon them. Yet the
latter philosopher as a rule not only regards the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">independent</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> position,
which he himself takes up in the name of </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">freedom of thought</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> and </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">freedom
of research,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> as the superior position, but as the only one consistent
with the dignity of human reason; and he commonly accuses the Christian
philosopher of allowing reason to be </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">enslaved</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> in </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">the shackles of
dogma</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. We can see at once the unfairness of such a charge when we
remember that the Christian philosopher has convinced himself </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">on grounds of
reason alone</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> that God exists and has made a revelation to man. His belief
in a Divine Revelation is a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">reasoned</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> belief, a </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">rationabile obsequium</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> (Rom.
XII. 1); and only if it were a blind belief, unjustifiable on grounds of reason,
would the accusation referred to be a fair one. The Christian philosopher
might retort that it is the unbelieving philosopher himself who really destroys
</span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">freedom of thought and research,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> by claiming for the latter what is really
an abuse of freedom, namely </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">license</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> to believe what reason shows to be
erroneous. But this counter-charge would be equally unfair, for the unbelieving
philosopher does not claim any such undue license to believe what
he knows to be false or to disbelieve what he knows to be true. If he denies
the fact or the possibility of a Divine Revelation, and therefore pursues his
philosophical investigations without any regard to the contents of such
revelation, it is because he has convinced himself on grounds of reason that
such revelation is neither a fact nor a possibility. He and the Christian
philosopher cannot both be right; one of them must be wrong; but as
reasonable men they should agree to differ rather than hurl unjustifiable
charges and counter-charges at each other.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
All philosophers who believe in the Christian Revelation and allow its
authentic teachings to guide and supplement their own rational investigation
into ultimate questions, are keenly conscious of the consequent superior
depth and fulness and certitude of Christian philosophy as compared with all
the other conflicting and fragmentary philosophies that mark the progress of
human speculation on the ultimate problems of man and the universe down
through the centuries. They feel secure in the possession of a </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">philosophia

that philosophy by the only full and authentic deposit of Divinely Revealed
Truth, which is to be found in the teaching of the Catholic Church.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The history of philosophical investigation yields no one
universally received conception of what philosophy is, nor
would the definition given above be unreservedly accepted.
Windelband, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">History of Philosophy</span></span><a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> instances the following
predominant conceptions of philosophy according to the chronological
order in which they prevailed: (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) the systematic investigation
of the problems raised by man and the universe (early
Grecian philosophy: absence of differentiation of philosophy
from the special sciences); (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) the practical art of human conduct,
based on rational speculation (later Grecian philosophy: distrust
in the value of knowledge, and emphasis on practical guidance
of conduct); (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) the helper and handmaid of the Science of Revealed
Truth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> supernatural theology, in the solution of
ultimate problems (the Christian philosophy of the Fathers of the
Church and of the Medieval Schools down to the sixteenth century:
universal recognition of the value of the Christian Revelation
as an aid to rational investigation); (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) a purely rational
investigation of those problems, going beyond the investigations
of the special sciences, and either abstracting from, or denying
the value of, any light or aid from Revelation (differentiation of
the domains of science, philosophy and theology; modern philosophies
from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century; excessive
individualism and rationalism of these as unnaturally divorced
from recognition of, and belief in, Divine Revelation, and unduly
isolated from the progressing positive sciences); (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) a critical
analysis of the significance and scope and limitations of human
knowledge itself (recent philosophies, mainly concerned with
theories of knowledge and speculations on the nature of the
cognitive process and the reliability of its products).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These various conceptions are interesting and suggestive;
much might be said about them, but not to any useful purpose
in a brief introductory chapter. Let us rather, adopting the
definition already set forth, try next to map out into its leading
departments the whole philosophical domain.

III. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Divisions of Philosophy: Speculative and Practical
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-variant: small-caps">
Philosophy.</span></span>—The general problem of classifying all the
sciences built up by human thought is a logical problem of no
little complexity when one tries to work it out in detail. We
refer to this general problem only to mention a widely accepted
principle on which it is usually approached, and because the
division of philosophy itself is a section of the general problem.
The principle in question is that sciences may be distinguished
indeed by partial or total <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">diversity of subject-matter</span></em>, but that
such diversity is not essential, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">diversity of standpoint</span></em> is
necessary and sufficient to constitute distinct sciences even when
these deal with one and the same subject-matter. Now applying
this principle to philosophy we see firstly that it has the same
subject-matter as all the special sciences taken collectively, but
that it is distinct from all of them inasmuch as it studies their
data not from the standpoint of the proximate causes, but from
the higher standpoint of the ultimate causes of these data. And
we see secondly that philosophy, having this one higher standpoint
throughout all its departments, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> science; that its
divisions are only material divisions; that there is not a plurality
of philosophies as there is a plurality of sciences, though there is
a plurality of departments in philosophy.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> Let us now see what
these departments are.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we ask why people seek knowledge at all, in any department,
we shall detect two main impelling motives. The first of
these is simply the desire to know: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">trahimur omnes cupiditate
sciendi</span></span>. The natural feeling of wonder, astonishment, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">admiratio</span></span>,”</span>
which accompanies our perception of things and events, prompts
us to seek their causes, to discover the reasons which will make
them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligible</span></em> to us and enable us to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">understand</span></em> them. But
while the possession of knowledge for its own sake is thus a
motive of research it is not the only motive. We seek knowledge
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in order to use it</span></em> for the guidance of our conduct in life,
for the orientation of our activities, for the improvement of our
condition; knowing that knowledge is power, we seek it in order
to make it minister to our needs. Now in the degree in which
it fulfils such ulterior purposes, or is sought for these purposes,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
knowledge may be described as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical</span></em>; in the degree in which
it serves no ulterior end, or is sought for no ulterior end, other
than that of perfecting our minds, it may be described as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">speculative</span></em>.
Of course this latter purpose is in itself a highly practical
purpose; nor indeed is there any knowledge, however speculative,
but has, or at least is capable of having, some influence or bearing
on the actual tenor and conduct of our lives; and in this
sense all knowledge is practical. Still we can distinguish broadly
between knowledge which has no direct, immediate bearing on
our acts, and knowledge that has.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> Hence the possibility of
distinguishing between two great domains of philosophical knowledge—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Theoretical</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Speculative Philosophy</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Practical
Philosophy</span></em>. There are, in fact, two great domains into which
the data of all human experience may be divided; and for each
distinct domain submitted to philosophical investigation there
will be a distinct department of philosophy. A first domain is
the order <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">realized</span></em> in the universe independently of man; a second
is the order which man himself <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">realizes</span></em>: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things</span></em>, therefore, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acts</span></em>. The order of the external universe, the order of nature as
it is called, exists independently of us: we merely study it
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">speculari</span></span>, θεωρέω), we do not create it. The other or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical</span></em>
order is established by our acts of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligence</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, and by
our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bodily action</span></em> on external things under the direction of those
faculties in the arts. Hence we have a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">speculative</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theoretical</span></em>
philosophy and a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical</span></em> philosophy.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>

IV. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Departments of Practical Philosophy: Logic,
Ethics and Esthetics.</span></span>—In the domain of human activities, to
the right regulation of which practical philosophy is directed, we
may distinguish two departments of mental activity, namely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellectual</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">volitional</span></em>, and besides these the whole department
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external</span></em>, executive or bodily activity. In general the right
regulation of acts may be said to consist in directing them to the
realization of some ideal; for all cognitive acts this ideal is the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em>, for all appetitive or volitional acts it is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>, while for
all external operations it may be either the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beautiful</span></em> or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">useful</span></em>—the
respective objects of the fine arts and the mechanical arts
or crafts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Logic</span></em>, as a practical science, studies the mental acts and processes
involved in discovering and proving truths and systematizing
these into sciences, with a view to directing these acts and
processes aright in the accomplishment of this complex task.
Hence it has for its subject-matter, in a certain sense, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the
data of human experience, or whatever can be an object of human
thought. But it studies these data not directly or in themselves
or for their own sake, but only in so far as our acts of reason, which
form its direct object, are brought to bear upon them. In all the
other sciences we employ thought to study the various objects of
thought as things, events, realities; and hence these may be
called <span class="tei tei-q">“real”</span> sciences, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientiae reales</span></span>; while in Logic we study
thought itself, and even here not speculatively for its own sake
or as a reality (as we study it for instance in Psychology), but
practically, as a process capable of being directed towards the
discovery and proof of truth; and hence in contradistinction
to the other sciences as <span class="tei tei-q">“real,”</span> we call Logic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“rational”</span>
science, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia rationalis</span></span>. Scholastic philosophers express this

in the attainment of scientific truth are conception, judgment
and inference; moreover these processes have to be exercised
methodically by the combined application of analysis and synthesis,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or induction and deduction, to the various domains of
human experience. All these processes, therefore, and the methods
of their application, constitute the proper subject-matter of Logic.
It has been more or less a matter of debate since the days of
Aristotle whether Logic should be regarded as a department of
philosophical science proper, or rather as a preparatory discipline,
an instrument or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">organon</span></span> of reasoning—as the collection of Aristotle's
own logical treatises was called,—and so as a vestibule or
introduction to philosophy. And there is a similar difference of
opinion as to whether or not it is advisable to set down Logic
as the first department to be studied in the philosophical curriculum.
Such doubts arise from differences of view as to the
questions to be investigated in Logic, and the point to which such
investigations should be carried therein. It is possible to distinguish
between a more elementary treatment of thought-processes
with the avowedly practical aim of setting forth canons of inference
and method which would help and train the mind to reason
and investigate correctly; and a more philosophical treatment
of those processes with the speculative aim of determining their
ultimate significance and validity as factors of knowledge, as
attaining to truth, as productive of science and certitude. It is
only the former field of investigation that is usually accorded to
Logic nowadays; and thus understood Logic ought to come first
in the curriculum as a preparatory training for philosophical
studies, accompanied, however, by certain elementary truths from
Psychology regarding the nature and functions of the human
mind. The other domain of deeper and more speculative investigation
was formerly explored in what was regarded as a
second portion of logical science, under the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“Critical”</span>
Logic—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Logica Critica</span></span>. In modern times this is regarded as a
distinct department of Speculative Philosophy, under the various
titles of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistemology</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Criteriology</span></span>, or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theory of Knowledge</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ethics or Moral Philosophy</span></span> (ἤθος, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mos</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mores</span></span>, morals, conduct)
is that department of practical philosophy which has for its
subject-matter all human acts, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> all acts elicited or commanded
by the will of man considered as a free, rational and responsible
agent. And it studies human conduct with the practical purpose
of discovering the ultimate end or object of this conduct, and the
principles whereby it must be regulated in order to attain to this
end. Ethics must therefore analyse and account for the distinction
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bad</span></em> in human conduct, for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its feature of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morality</span></em>. It must examine the motives that
influence conduct: pleasure, well-being, happiness, duty, obligation,
moral law, etc. The supreme determining factor in all
such considerations will obviously be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the ultimate end of man</span></em>,
whatever this may be: his destiny as revealed by a study of his
nature and place in the universe. Now the nature of man is
studied in Psychology, as are also the nature, conditions and
effects of his free acts, and the facilities, dispositions and forms
of character consequent on these. Furthermore, not only from
the study of man in Psychology, but from the study of the
external universe in Cosmology, we amass data from which in
Natural Theology we establish the existence of a Supreme Being.
We then prove in Ethics that the last end of man, his highest
perfection, consists in knowing, loving, serving, and thus glorifying
God, both in this life and in the next. Hence we can see
how these branches of speculative philosophy subserve the
practical science of morals. And since a man's interpretation of
the moral distinctions—as of right or wrong, meritorious or blameworthy,
autonomous or of obligation—which he recognizes as
pertaining to his own actions—since his interpretation of these
distinctions is so intimately bound up with his religious outlook
and beliefs, it is at once apparent that the science of Ethics will
be largely influenced and determined by the system of speculative
philosophy which inspires it, whether this be Theism, Monism,
Agnosticism, etc. No doubt the science of Ethics must take as
its data all sorts of moral beliefs, customs and practices prevalent
at any time among men; but it is not a speculative science
which would merely aim at <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> inferences or inductive
generalizations from these data; it is a practical, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">normative</span></em> science
which aims at discovering the truth as to what is the right and
the wrong in human conduct, and at pointing out the right
application of the principles arising out of this truth. Hence it
is of supreme importance for the philosopher of morals to determine
whether the human race has really been vouchsafed a
Divine Revelation, and, convincing himself that Christianity
contains such a revelation, to recognize the possibility of supplementing
and perfecting what his own natural reason can discover
by what the Christian religion teaches about the end of man as
the supreme determining principle of human conduct. Not that
he is to take the revealed truths of Christianity as principles of
moral <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophy</span></em>; for these are the principles of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supernatural
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
Christian Theology</span></em> of human morals; but that as a Christian
philosopher, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> a philosopher who recognizes the truth of the
Christian Revelation, he should reason out philosophically a
science of Ethics which, so far as it goes, will be in harmony
with the moral teachings of the Christian Religion, and will
admit of being perfected by these. This recognition, as already
remarked, will not be a hindrance but a help to him in exploring
the wide domains of the individual, domestic, social
and religious conduct of man; in determining, on the basis of
theism established by natural reason, the right moral conditions
and relations of man's conduct as an individual, as a member of
the family, as a member of the state, and as a creature of God.
The nature, source and sanction of authority, domestic, social
and religious; of the dictate of conscience; of the natural moral
law and of all positive law; of the moral virtues and vices—these
are all questions which the philosopher of Ethics has to
explore by the use of natural reason, and for the investigation
of which the Christian philosopher of Ethics is incomparably
better equipped than the philosopher who, though possessing the
compass of natural reason, ignores the beacon lights of Divinely
Revealed Truths.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Esthetics</span></em>, or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophy of the Fine Arts</span></em>, is that department
of philosophy which studies the conception of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beautiful</span></em> and
its external expression in the works of nature and of man. The
arts themselves, of course, whether concerned with the realization
of the useful or of the beautiful, are distinct from sciences, even
from practical sciences.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">technique</span></em> itself consists in a skill
acquired by practice—by practice guided, however, by a set of
practical canons or rules which are the ripe fruit of experience.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>
But behind every art there is always some background of more or
less speculative truth. The conception of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">useful</span></em>, however
which underlies the mechanical arts and crafts, is not an ultimate
conception calling for any further analysis than it receives in the
various special sciences and in metaphysics. But the conception of
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beautiful</span></em> does seem to demand a special philosophical consideration.
On the subjective or mental side the esthetic sense, artistic
taste, the sentiment of the beautiful, the complex emotions accompanying
such experience; on the objective side the elements
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or factors requisite to produce this experience; the relation of
the esthetic to the moral, of the beautiful to the good and the
true—these are all distinctly philosophical questions. Up to the
present time, however, their treatment has been divided between
the other departments of philosophy—psychology, cosmology,
natural theology, general metaphysics, ethics—rather than grouped
together to form an additional distinct department.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Departments of Speculative Philosophy: Metaphysics.</span></span>—The
philosophy which studies the order realized in
things apart from our activity, speculative philosophy, has been
variously divided up into separate departments from the first
origins of philosophical speculation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we remember that all intellectual knowledge of things
involves the apprehension of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general</span></em> truths or laws about these
things, and that this apprehension of intelligible aspects common
to a more or less extensive group of things involves the exercise
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstraction</span></em>, we can understand how the whole domain of speculative
knowledge, whether scientific or philosophical, can be differentiated
into certain layers or levels, so to speak, according to
various degrees of abstractness and universality in the intelligible
aspects under which the data of our experience may be considered.
On this principle Aristotle and the scholastics divided all speculative
knowledge into three great domains, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Physics</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mathematics</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Metaphysics</span></em>, with their respective proper objects, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Change</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quantity</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Being</span></em>, objects which are successively apprehended in
three great stages of abstraction traversed by the human mind in
its effort to understand and explain the Universal Order of things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And as a matter of fact perhaps the first great common and
most obvious feature which strikes the mind reflecting on the
visible universe is the feature of all-pervading change (κίνησις),
movement, evolution, progress and regress, growth and decay;
we see it everywhere in a variety of forms, mechanical or local
change, quantitative change, qualitative change, vital change.
Now the knowledge acquired by the study of things under this
common aspect is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Physics</span></em>. Here the mind abstracts merely
from the individualizing differences of this change in individual
things, and fixes its attention on the great, common, sensible
aspect itself of visible change.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the mind can abstract even from the sensible changes
that take place in the physical universe and fix its attention on
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">static</span></em> feature in the changing things. This static element
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(τὸ ἀκίνητον), which the intellect apprehends in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> things
as naturally inseparable from them (ἀκίνητον ἀλλ᾽ οὐ χωριστόν),
is their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantity</span></em>, their extension in space. When the mind strips
a material object of all its visible, sensible properties—on which
its mechanical, physical and chemical changes depend—there
still remains as an object of thought a something formed of parts
outside parts in three dimensions of space. This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstract</span></em> quantity,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quantitas intelligibilis</span></span>—whether as continuous or discontinuous,
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">magnitude</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">multitude</span></em>—is the proper object of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mathematics</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the mind can penetrate farther still into the reality of
the material data which it finds endowed with the attributes of
change and quantity: it can eliminate from the object of its
thought even this latter or mathematical attribute, and seize on
something still more fundamental. The very essence, substance,
nature, being itself, of the thing, the underlying subject and root
principle of all the thing's operations and attributes, is something
deeper than any of these attributes, something at least mentally
distinct from these latter (τὸ ἀκίνητον και χωριστόν): and this
something is the proper object of man's highest speculative
knowledge, which Aristotle called ἡ πρώτη φιλοσοφία, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophia
prima</span></span>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fundamental</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deepest</span></em> philosophy.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But he gave this latter order of knowledge another very
significant title: he called it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theology</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theological science</span></em>,
ἐπιστήμη θεολογίκή, by a denomination derived <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a potiori parte</span></span>,
from its nobler part, its culmination in the knowledge of God.
Let us see how. For Aristotle <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first philosophy</span></em> is the science of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being and its essential attributes</span></em>.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> Here the mind apprehends its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
object as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">static</span></em> or abstracted from change, and as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immaterial</span></em> or
abstracted from quantity, the fundamental attribute of material
reality—as ἀκίνητον καὶ χωριστόν. Now it is the substance,
nature, or essence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the things of our direct and immediate experience</span></em>,
that forms the proper object of this highest science. But in
these things the substance, nature, or essence, is not found in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real and actual</span></em> separation from the material attributes of change
and quantity; it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">considered</span></em> separately from these only by an
effort of mental abstraction. Even the nature of man himself is
not wholly immaterial; nor is the spiritual principle in man, his
soul, entirely exempt from material conditions. Hence in so far
as first philosophy studies the being of the things of our direct
experience, its object is immaterial only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">negatively</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by mental
abstraction</span></em>. But does this study bring within the scope of our
experience any being or reality that is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positively and actually</span></em>
exempt from all change and all material conditions? If so the
study of this being, the Divine Being, will be the highest effort,
the crowning perfection, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first philosophy</span></em>; which we may therefore
call the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theological</span></em> science. <span class="tei tei-q">“If,”</span> writes Aristotle,<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“there
really exists a substance absolutely immutable and immaterial,
in a word, a Divine Being—as we hope to prove—then such
Being must be the absolutely first and supreme principle, and
the science that attains to such Being will be theological.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this triple division of speculative philosophy into Physics,
Mathematics, and Metaphysics, it will naturally occur to one
to ask: Did Aristotle distinguish between what he called Physics
and what we nowadays call the special physical sciences? He
did. These special <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">analytic</span></em> studies of the various departments
of the physical universe, animate and inanimate, Aristotle described
indiscriminately as <span class="tei tei-q">“partial”</span> sciences: αἱ ἐν μέρει ἐπιστημάι—ἐπιστημαὶ
ἐν μέρει λεγόμεναι. These descriptive, inductive,
comparative studies, proceeding <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> from effects to causes,
he conceived rather as a preparation for scientific knowledge
proper; this latter he conceived to be a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">synthetic</span></em>, deductive
explanation of things, in the light of some common aspect detected
in them as principle or cause of all their concrete characteristics.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a>
Such synthetic knowledge of things, in the light of
some such common aspect as change, is what he regarded as
scientific knowledge, meaning thereby what we mean by philosophical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
knowledge.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> What he called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Physics</span></em>, therefore, is what
we nowadays understand as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cosmology</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Psychology</span></em>.<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mathematical science Aristotle likewise regarded as science
in the full and perfect sense, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> as philosophical. But just as
we distinguish nowadays between the special physical and human
sciences on the one hand, and the philosophy of external nature
and man on the other, so we may distinguish between the special
mathematical sciences and a Philosophy of Mathematics: with
this difference, that while the former groups of special sciences
are mainly inductive the mathematical group is mainly deductive.
Furthermore, the Philosophy of Mathematics—which investigates
questions regarding the ultimate significance of mathematical
concepts, axioms and assumptions: unity, multitude, magnitude,
quantity, space, time, etc.—does not usually form a separate department
in the philosophical curriculum: its problems are dealt
with as they arise in the other departments of Metaphysics.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before outlining the modern divisions of Metaphysics we
may note that this latter term was not used by Aristotle. We
owe it probably to Andronicus of Rhodes († 40 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), who, when
arranging a complete edition of Aristotle's works, placed next in
order after the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Physics</span></span>, or physical treatises, all the parts and
fragments of the master's works bearing upon the immutable and
immaterial object of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophia prima</span></span>; these he labelled
τὰ μετὰ τὰ (βιβλία) φυσικα, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">post physica</span></span>, the books <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after the

section of speculative philosophy. It was soon noticed that the
term, thus fortuitously applied to such investigations, conveyed a
very appropriate description of their scope and character if interpreted
in the sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supra</span></em>-physica,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trans</span></em>-physica”</span>: inasmuch
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as the object of these investigations is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hyperphysical</span></em>
object, an object that is either positively and really, or negatively
and by abstraction, beyond the material conditions of quantity
and change. St. Thomas combines both meanings of the term
when he says that the study of its subject-matter comes naturally
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after</span></em> the study of physics, and that we naturally pass from the
study of the sensible to that of the suprasensible.<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a>

VI. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Departments of Metaphysics: Cosmology, Psychology,
and Natural Theology.</span></span>—Nowadays the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Metaphysics</span></em>
is understood as synonymous with speculative philosophy:
the investigation of the being, nature, or essence, and essential
attributes of the realities which are also studied in the various
special sciences: the search for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ultimate</span></em> grounds, reasons
and causes of these realities, of which the proximate explanations
are sought in the special sciences. We have seen that it has for
its special object that most abstract aspect of reality whereby
the latter is conceived as changeless and immaterial; and we
have seen that a being may have these attributes either by
mental abstraction merely, or in actual reality. In other words
the philosophical study of things that are really material not
only suggests the possibility, but establishes the actual existence,
of a Being that is really changeless and immaterial: so that
metaphysics in all its amplitude would be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the philosophical science
of things that are negatively</span></em> (by abstraction) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or positively</span></em> (in
reality) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immaterial</span></em>. This distinction suggests a division of
metaphysics into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">special</span></em> metaphysics. The former
would be the philosophical study of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> being, considered by
mental abstraction as immaterial; the latter would be the philosophical
study of the really and positively changeless and immaterial
Being,—God. The former would naturally fall into two

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cosmology</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Psychology</span></em> divide between them the whole
domain of man's immediate experience. Cosmology, utilizing
not only the data of direct experience, but also the conclusions
established by the analytic study of these data in the physical
sciences, explores the origin, nature, and destiny of the material
universe. Some philosophers include among the data of Cosmology
all the phenomena of vegetative life, reserving sentient
and rational life for Psychology; others include even sentient
life in Cosmology, reserving the study of human life for Psychology,
or, as they would call it, Anthropology.<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> The mere matter
of location is of secondary importance. Seeing, however, that
man embodies in himself all three forms of life, vegetative, sentient,
and rational, all three would perhaps more naturally belong to
Psychology, which would be the philosophical study of life in
all its manifestations (ψυχή, the vital principle, the soul). Just
as the conclusions of the physical sciences are the data of Cosmology,
so the conclusions of the natural or biological sciences—Zoology,
Botany, Physiology, Morphology, Cellular Biology,
etc.—are the data of Psychology. Indeed in Psychology itself—especially
in more recent years—it is possible to distinguish a
positive, analytic, empirical study of the phenomena of consciousness,
a study which would rank rather as a special than as an
ultimate or philosophical science; and a synthetic, rational study
of the results of this analysis, a study which would be strictly
philosophical in character. This would have for its object to
determine the origin, nature and destiny of living things in
general and of man himself in particular. It would inquire into
the nature and essential properties of living matter, into the nature
of the subject of conscious states, into the operations and faculties
of the human mind, into the nature of the human soul and its
mode of union with the body, into the rationality of the human
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
intellect and the freedom of the human will, the spirituality and
immortality of the human soul, etc.

But since the human mind itself is the natural instrument
whereby man acquires <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> his knowledge, it will be at once apparent
that the study of the phenomenon of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> itself, of
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cognitive</span></em> activity of the mind, can be studied, and must be
studied, not merely as a natural phenomenon of the mind, but
from the point of view of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its special significance as representative</span></em>
of objects other than itself, from the point of view of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its validity

the scope and limitations and conditions of its objective
validity. We have already referred to the study of human knowledge
from this standpoint, in connexion with what was said
above concerning Logic. It has a close kinship with Logic on
the one hand, and with Psychology on the other; and nowadays
it forms a distinct branch of speculative Philosophy under the
title of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Criteriology</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistemology</span></em>, or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Theory of Knowledge</span></em>.

Arising out of the data of our direct experience, external and

we find a variety of evidences all pointing beyond the domain of

its Creator, Conserver, and Ruler, its First Beginning and its Last
End, its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Alpha</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Omega</span></em>, One Divine and Infinite Being, the

speculative philosophy would utilize as data the conclusions
of the special sciences—physical, biological, and human. It would
try to reach a deeper explanation of their data by synthesizing
these under the wider aspects of change, quantity, and being, thus
bringing to light the ultimate causes, reasons, and explanatory
principles of things. This whole study would naturally fall into
two great branches: General Metaphysics (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cosmology</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Psychology</span></em>), which would study things exempt from quantity
and change not really but only by mental abstraction; and
Special Metaphysics (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Natural Theology</span></em>), which would study the
positively immaterial and immutable Being of the Deity.

the erroneous attitude that prompted it in the first instance, has
much to recommend it from the standpoint of practical convenience
of treatment. The modern division was introduced by
Wolff (1679-1755), a German philosopher,—a disciple of Leibniz
(1646-1716) and forerunner of Kant (1724-1804).<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> Influenced
by the excessively deductive method of Leibniz' philosophy,
which he sought to systematize and to popularize, he wrongly conceived
the metaphysical study of reality as something wholly
apart and separate from the inductive investigation of this same
reality in the positive sciences. It comprised the study of the
most fundamental and essential principles of being, considered in
themselves; and the deductive application of these principles to
the three great domains of actual reality, the corporeal universe,
the human soul, and God. The study of the first principles of
being in themselves would constitute <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">General Metaphysics</span></em>, or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ontology</span></em> (ὄντος-λόγος). Their applications would constitute three
great departments of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Special Metaphysics</span></em>: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cosmology</span></em>, which he
described as <span class="tei tei-q">“transcendental”</span> in opposition to the experimental
physical sciences; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Psychology</span></em>, which he termed <span class="tei tei-q">“rational”</span> in opposition
to the empirical biological sciences; and finally Natural
Theology, which he entitled <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Theodicy</span></em> (Θεός-δίκη-δικαιόω), using
a term invented by Leibniz for his essays in vindication of the
wisdom and justice of Divine Providence notwithstanding the
evils of the universe.

Without in any way countenancing such an isolation of
metaphysics from the positive sciences, we may, nevertheless,
adopt the modern division in substance and in practice. While
recognizing the intimate connexion between the special sciences
and metaphysics in all its branches, we may regard as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">General
Metaphysics</span></em> all inquiries into the fundamental principles of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em>
and of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em>, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reality</span></em> and of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em>; and as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Special
Metaphysics</span></em> the philosophical study of physical nature, of human
nature, and of God, the Author and Supreme Cause of all finite
reality. Thus, while special metaphysics would embrace Cosmology,
Psychology, and Natural Theology, general metaphysics
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would embrace Ontology and Epistemology. These two latter
disciplines must no doubt investigate what is in a certain sense
one and the same subject-matter, inasmuch as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> is
knowledge of reality, nor can the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing mind</span></em> (the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">subjectum
cognoscens</span></span>) and the known reality (the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">objectum cognitum</span></span>) be
wholly separated or studied in complete isolation from each
other. Yet the whole content of human experience, which
forms their common subject-matter, can be regarded by mental
abstraction from the two distinct standpoints of the knowing
mind and the known reality, and can thus give rise to two
distinct sets of problems. Epistemology is thus concerned with
the truth and certitude of human knowledge; with the subjective
conditions and the scope and limits of its validity; with the subjective
or mental factors involved in knowing.<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> Ontology is
concerned with the objects of knowledge, with reality considered
in the widest, deepest, and most fundamental aspects under which
it is conceived by the human mind: with the being and becoming
of reality, its possibility and its actuality, its essence and its existence,
its unity and plurality; with the aspects of truth, goodness,
perfection, beauty, which it assumes in relation with our minds;
with the contingency of finite reality and the grounds and implications
both of its actual existence and of its intelligibility; with
the modes of its concrete existence and behaviour, the supreme
categories of reality as they are called: substance, individual
nature, and personality; quantity, space and time, quality and
relation, causality and purpose. These are the principal topics
investigated in the present volume. The investigation is confined
to fundamental concepts and principles, leaving their applications
to be followed out in special metaphysics. Furthermore,
the theory of knowledge known as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Moderate Realism</span></em>,<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> the
Realism of Aristotle and the Scholastics, in regard to the validity
of knowledge both sensual and intellectual, is assumed throughout:
because not alone is this the true theory, but—as a natural
consequence—it is the only theory which renders the individual
things and events of human experience really intelligible, and
at the same time keeps the highest and most abstract intellectual
speculations of metaphysics in constant and wholesome contact
with the concrete, actual world in which we live, move, and have
our being.

student, especially the beginner, will find the investigations in

of our intellectual concepts, be they ever so abstract and universal,
is really embodied in the individual things and events of
his daily experience, he will not be disposed to denounce all
ultimate analysis of these concepts as <span class="tei tei-q">“unprofitable”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“unreal”</span>.

certain philosophers of his time, tells against the metaphysical
speculations of Conceptualism, but not against those of Moderate
Realism. The reproach is commonly cast at <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> systematic
metaphysics nowadays—from prejudices too numerous and varied

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But really in order to dispel all such misgivings one has
only to remember that metaphysics, systematic or otherwise, is
nothing more than a man's reasoned outlook on the world and
life. Whatever his conscious opinions and convictions may be
regarding the nature and purpose of himself, and other men, and
the world at large—and if he use his reason at all he must have
some sort of opinions and convictions, whether positive or
negative, on these matters—those opinions and convictions are
precisely that man's metaphysics. <span class="tei tei-q">“Breaking free for the

But if this is so, surely a systematic attempt to <span class="tei tei-q">“get at reality,”</span>
no matter how deep and wide, no matter how abstract and

us, cannot nevertheless always and of necessity have the effect
of involving us in a mirage of illusion and unreality.

Thus considered it appears as the least abstract and foreign to concrete

But metaphysics is bound by its very nature and calling always to keep near
to the actual and to the concrete. Dive into the depths of speculation indeed
it may; and its ocean is boundless in expanse and deep beyond all reach
of human plummets. But it finds its place of standing, for every new turn

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The wonderful progress of the positive sciences during the
last few centuries has been the occasion of prejudice against
metaphysics in a variety of ways. It is objected, for instance,
that metaphysics has no corresponding progress to boast of; and
from this there is but a small step to the conclusion that all
metaphysical speculation is sterile. The comparison is unfair for
many reasons. Research into the ultimate grounds and causes
of things is manifestly more difficult than research into their
proximate grounds and causes. Again, while the positive sciences
have increased our knowledge mainly in extent rather than in
depth, it is metaphysics and only metaphysics that can increase
this knowledge in its unity, comprehensiveness, and significance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A positive increase in our knowledge of the manifold data of
human experience is not the aim of metaphysics; its aim is to
give an ultimate meaning and interpretation to this knowledge.
It is not utilitarian in the narrower sense in which the positive
and special sciences are utilitarian by ministering to our material
needs; but in the higher and nobler sense of pointing out to us
the bearing of all human knowledge and achievement on our real
nature and destiny. True, indeed, individual leaders and schools
of metaphysics have strayed from the truth and spoken with conflicting
and uncertain voices, especially when they have failed to
avail themselves of Truth Divinely Revealed. This, however, is
not a failure of metaphysics but of individual metaphysicians.
And furthermore, it is undeniable withal, that the metaphysical
labours of the great philosophers in all ages have contributed
richly to the enlightenment and civilization of mankind—particularly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when these labours have been in concord and co-operation
with the elevating and purifying influences of the Christian religion.
Of no metaphysical system is this so entirely true as of that embodied
in Scholastic Philosophy. The greatest intellect of the
Middle Ages, St. Thomas Aquinas, gave to this philosophy an
expression which is rightly regarded by the modern scholastic
as his intellectual charter and the most worthy starting-point
of his philosophical investigations. The following passage from
an eminent representative of modern scholastic thought<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> is sufficiently
suggestive to admit of quotation:—

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Amid the almost uninterrupted disintegration of systems during the
last three centuries, the philosophy of St. Thomas has alone been able to
stand the shock of criticism; it alone has proved sufficiently solid and comprehensive
to serve as an intellectual basis and unifying principle for all the
new facts and phenomena brought to light by the modern sciences. And
unless we are much mistaken, those who take up and follow this philosophy
will come to think, as we do, that on the analysis of mental acts and processes,
on the inner nature of corporeal things, of living things, and of man, on the
existence and nature of God, on the foundations of speculative and moral
science, none have thought or written more wisely than St. Thomas Aquinas.
But though we place our programme and teaching under the patronage of
the illustrious name of this prince of scholastics, we do not regard the
Thomistic philosophy as an ideal beyond possibility of amelioration, or as a
boundary to the activity of the human mind. We do think, however, on
mature reflection, that we are acting no less wisely than modestly in taking it
as our starting-point and constant standard of reference. This we say in
answer to those of our friends and enemies who are occasionally pleased to
ask us if we really do mean to lead back the modern mind into the Middle
Ages, and to identify philosophy </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">simply</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> with the thought of any </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">one</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> philosopher.

An overweening confidence in the power of the special sciences
to solve ultimate questions, or at least to tell us all that can be
known for certain about these problems, a confidence based on
the astonishing progress of those sciences in modern times, is the
source of yet another prejudice against metaphysics. It is a
prejudice of the half-educated mind, of the camp-followers of
science, not of its leaders. These latter are keenly conscious
that the solution of ultimate questions lies entirely beyond the
methods of the special sciences. Not that even the most eminent
scientists do not indulge in speculations about ultimate problems—as
they have a perfect right to do. But though they may be
themselves quite aware that such speculations are distinctly
metaphysical, there are multitudes who seem to think that a
theory ceases to be metaphysical and becomes scientific provided
only it is broached by a scientific expert as distinct from a metaphysician.<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a>
But all sincere thinkers will recognize that no ultimate
question about the totality of human experience can be
solved by any science which explores merely a portion of this
experience. Nay, the more rapid and extensive is the progress of
the various special sciences, the more imperative and insistent
becomes the need to collect and collate their separate findings, to
interrogate them one and all as to whether and how far these
findings fit in with the facts and conditions of human life and
existence, to determine what light and aid they contribute to the
solution of the great and ever recurring questions of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whence</span></em>?
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whither</span></em>? and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em>? of man and the universe. One who is
a sincere scientist as well as an earnest philosopher has written
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">à propos</span></span> of this necessity in the following terms:—

The farther science has pushed back the limits of the discernible universe,
the more insistently do we feel the demand within us for some satisfactory
explanation of the whole. The old, eternal problems rise up before
us and clamour loudly and ever more loudly for some newer and better
solution. The solution offered by a bygone age was soothing at least, if it
was not final. In the present age, however, the problems reappear with

an acuteness that is almost painful: the deep secret of our own human
nature, the questions of our origin and destiny, the intermeddling of
blind necessity and chance and pain in the strange, tangled drama of our
existence, the foibles and oddities of the human soul, and all the mystifying
problems of social relations: are not these all so many enigmas which torment
and trouble us whithersoever we turn? And all seem to circle around the
one essential question: Has human nature a real meaning and value, or is it
so utterly amiss that truth and peace will never be its portion?</span><a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A final difficulty against philosophical research is suggested
by the thought that if the philosopher has to take cognizance of
all the conclusions of all the special sciences his task is an impossible
one, inasmuch as nowadays at all events it would take
a lifetime to become proficient in a few of these sciences not to
speak of all of them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is no question, however, of becoming proficient in them;
the philosopher need not be a specialist in any positive science;
his acquaintance with the contents of these sciences need extend
no farther than such established conclusions and such current
though unverified hypotheses as have an immediate bearing on
ultimate or philosophical problems.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, while it would be injurious both to philosophy and
to science, as is proved by the history of both alike, to separate
synthetic from analytic speculation by a divorce between philosophy
and science; while it would be unwise to ignore the conclusions
of the special sciences and to base philosophical research
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exclusively</span></em> on the data of the plain man's common and unanalysed
experience, it must be remembered on the other hand that the
most fundamental truths of speculative and practical philosophy,
the truths that are most important for the right and proper
orientation of human life, can be established and defended independently
of the special researches of the positive sciences. The
human mind had not to await the discovery of radium in order
to prove the existence of God. Such supreme truths as the existence
of God, the immortality of the human soul, the freedom of
the human will, the existence of a moral law, the distinction between
right and wrong, etc., have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></em> in possession of
the human race. It has been, moreover, confirmed in its possession
of them by Divine Revelation. And it has not needed
either the rise or the progress of modern science to defend them.
These fundamental rational truths constitute a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophia perennis</span></span>:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a fund of truth which is, like all truth, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immutable</span></em>, though our
human insight into it may develop in depth and clearness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But while this is so it is none the less true that philosophy,
to be progressive in its own order, must take account of every
new fact and conclusion brought to light in every department of
scientific—and historical, and artistic, and literary, and every
other sort of—research. And this for the simple reason that every
such accession, whether of fact or of theory, is an enlargement
of human experience; as such it clamours on the one hand for
philosophical interpretation, for explanation in the light of what
we know already about the ultimate grounds and causes of things,
for admission into our world-outlook, for adjustment and co-ordination
with the previous contents of the latter; while, on the
other hand, by its very appearance on the horizon of human experience
it may enrich or illumine, rectify or otherwise influence,
this outlook or some aspect of it.<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If, then, philosophy has to take account of advances in every
other department of human research, it is clear that its mastery
at the present day is a more laborious task than ever it was in
the past. In order to get an intelligent grasp of its principles in
their applications to the problems raised by the progress of the
sciences, to newly discovered facts and newly propounded hypotheses,
the student must be familiar with these facts and hypotheses;
and all the more so because through the medium of a
sensational newspaper press that has more regard for novelty
than truth, these facts and hypotheses are no sooner brought to
light by scientists than what are often garbled and distorted
versions of them are circulated among the masses.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a>

Similarly, in order that a sound system of speculative and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
practical philosophy be expounded, developed, and defended at
the present time, a system that will embrace and co-ordinate the
achieved results of modern scientific research, a system that will
offer the most satisfactory solutions of old difficulties in new
forms and give the most reasonable and reliable answers to the
ever recurring questionings of man concerning his own nature
and destiny—it is clear that the insufficiency of individual effort
must be supplemented by the co-operation of numbers. It is
the absence of fulness, completeness, adequacy, in most modern
systems of philosophy, their fragmentary character, the unequal
development of their parts, that accounts very largely for the
despairing attitude of the many who nowadays despise and turn
away from philosophical speculation. Add to this the uncertain
voice with which these philosophies speak in consequence of
their advocates ignoring the implications of the most stupendous
fact in human experience,—the Christian Revelation. But there
is one philosophy which is free from these defects, a philosophy
which is in complete harmony with Revealed Truth, and which
forms with the latter the only true <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophy of Life</span></em>; and that
one philosophy is the system which, assimilating the wisdom of
Plato, Aristotle and all the other greatest thinkers of the world,
has been traditionally expounded in the Christian schools—the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Scholastic</span></em> system of philosophy. It has been elaborated
by no one man, and is the original fruit of no one mind. Unlike
the philosophies of Kant or Hegel or Spencer or James or
Comte or Bergson, it is not a <span class="tei tei-q">“one-man”</span> philosophy. It cannot
boast of the novelty or originality of the many eccentric and
ephemeral <span class="tei tei-q">“systems”</span> which have succeeded one another so
rapidly in recent times in the world of intellectual fashion; but
it has ever possessed the enduring novelty of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em>, which is
ever ancient and ever new. Now although this philosophy may
have been mastered in its broad outlines and applications by
specially gifted individuals in past ages, its progressive exposition
and development, and its application to the vastly extended
and ever-growing domains of experience that are being constantly
explored by the special sciences, can never be the work of
any individual: it can be accomplished only by the earnest
co-operation of Christian philosophers in every part of the
civilized world.<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a>

But the
participle has come to be used as a noun; and as such it does
not necessarily imply actual existence <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">hic et nunc</span></span>. It does indeed
imply some relation to actual existence; for we designate
as <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> (in the substantive sense) only whatever we conceive
as actually existing or at least as capable of existing; and it is
from the participial sense, which implies actual existence, that
the substantive sense has been derived. Moreover, the intelligible
use of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> as a term implies a reference to some
actually existing sphere of reality.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> It is in the substantive
meaning the term will be most frequently used in these pages, as
the context will show. When we speak of <span class="tei tei-q">“a being”</span> in the
concrete, the word has the same meaning as <span class="tei tei-q">“thing”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">res</span></span>) used
in the wide sense in which this latter includes persons, places,
events, facts and phenomena of whatsoever kind. In the same
sense we speak of <span class="tei tei-q">“a reality,”</span> this term having taken on a concrete,
in addition to its original abstract, meaning. <span class="tei tei-q">“Being”</span> has
also this abstract sense when we speak of <span class="tei tei-q">“the being or reality
of things”</span>. Finally it may be used in a collective sense to
indicate the sum-total of all that is or can be—all reality.

Not, of course, that we remember having formed it before any

this absolutely indeterminate confusion (we may not call it a </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">synthesis</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> or

negative, of affirmation and denial, would be conceived by our finite minds
as the objective correlative of, and at the same time as absolutely identical
with, its subjective correlative which is </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">pure thought</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. Well, it is with the
human mind and its objects, and how it thinks those objects, that we are
concerned at present; not with speculations involving the gratuitous assumption
of a Being that would transcend all duality of subject and object, all
determinateness of knowing and being, all distinction of thought and thing.
We believe that the human mind can establish the existence of a Supreme
Being whose mode of Thought and Existence transcends all human comprehension,
but it can do so only as the culminating achievement of all its
speculation; and the transcendent Being it thus reaches has nothing in
common with the monistic ideal-real being of Hegel's philosophy. In endeavouring

derive it from the data of our experience, and the process by which
we reach it is a process of abstraction. We lay aside all the
differences whereby things are distinguished from one another;
we do not consider these differences; we prescind or abstract

separation effected is only mental, subjective, notional, formal,
negative; not objective, not real, not positive. Hence the process
by which we narrow down the concept of being to the more
comprehensive concept of this or that generic or specific mode of
being, does not add to the former concept anything really new,
or distinct from, or extraneous to it; but rather brings out explicitly
something that was implicit in the latter. The composition
of being with its modes is, therefore, only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical</span></em> composition,
not real.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, it would seem that when we abstract a
generic mode of being from the specific modes subordinate to
the former, we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positively exclude</span></em> the differentiating characteristics
of these species; and that, conversely, when we narrow down the
genus to a subordinate species we do so by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adding on</span></em> a differentiating
mode which was not contained even implicitly in the generic
concept. Thus, for example, the differentiating concept <span class="tei tei-q">“rational”</span>
is not contained even implicitly in the generic concept <span class="tei tei-q">“animal”</span>:
it is added on <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ab extra</span></span> to the latter<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> in order to reach the specific
concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“rational animal”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span>; so that in abstracting
the generic from the subordinate specific concept we prescind
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectively</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> from the differentiating concept, by positively
excluding this latter. This kind of abstraction is called objective,
real, positive; and the composition of such generic and differentiating
modes of being is technically known as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metaphysical</span></em> composition.
The different modes of being, which the mind can
distinguish at different levels of abstraction in any specific concept—such
as <span class="tei tei-q">“rational,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“sentient,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“living,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“corporeal,”</span> in the

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span>) Since the notion of being is so simple that it cannot be

We can only
describe it by considering it from various points of view and
comparing it with the various modes in which we find it realized.
This is what we have been attempting so far. Considering its
fundamental relation to existence we might say that <span class="tei tei-q">“Being is
that which exists or is at least capable of existing”</span>: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ens est id

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>) The notion of being is so universal that it transcends all

is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not itself a generic, but a transcendental notion</span></em>. Wider than
all, even the widest and highest genera, it is not itself a genus.
A genus is determinable into its species by the addition of differences

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

which lie outside the concept of the genus, while they all

each of them and is predicated in the same sense of each. But
the characteristics which differentiate all genera and species from
one another, and from the common notion of being, in which
they all agree, are likewise <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em>. That in which they differ
is being, as well as that in which they agree. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hence we do not
predicate </span><span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span><span style="font-style: italic"> univocally of its various modes.</span></em> When we
say of the various classes of things which make up our
experience that they are <span class="tei tei-q">“real”</span> (or <span class="tei tei-q">“realities,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“beings”</span>),
we do not apply this predicate in altogether the same sense
to the several classes; for as applied to each class it connotes
the whole content of each, not merely the part in which
this agrees with, but also the part in which it differs from, the
others. Nor yet do we apply the concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> in a totally
different sense to each separate determinate mode of being.
When we predicate <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> of its modes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the predication is not
merely equivocal</span></em>. The concept expressed by the predicate-term
<span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> is not totally different as applied to each subject-mode;
for in all cases alike it implies either actual existence or some relation
thereto. It only remains, therefore, that we must regard
the notion of being, when predicated of its several modes, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as
partly the same and partly different</span></em>; and this is what we mean
when we say that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the concept of being is analogical, that being is
predicated analogically of its various modes</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Analogical predication is of two kinds: a term or concept
may be affirmed of a variety of subjects either by analogy <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of attribution</span></em>
or by analogy <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of proportion</span></em>. We may, for instance, speak
not only of a man as <span class="tei tei-q">“healthy,”</span> but also of his food, his countenance,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his occupation, his companionship, etc., as <span class="tei tei-q">“healthy”</span>.
Now health is found really only in the man, but it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">attributed</span></em>
to the other things owing to some extrinsic but real connexion
which they have with his health, whether as cause, or effect, or
indication, of the latter. This is analogy of attribution; the
subject of which the predicate is properly and primarily affirmed
being known as the primary analogue or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">analogum princeps</span></span>,
those to which it is transferred being called the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">analogata</span></span>. It
underlies the figures of speech known as metynomy and synechdoche.
Now on account of the various relations that exist between
the different modes of being, relations of cause and effect,
whole and part, means and end, ground and consequence, etc.—relations
which constitute the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">orders</span></em> of existing and possible
things, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metaphysical</span></em> orders—being is of course
predicated of its modes by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">analogy of attribution</span></em>; and in such
predication infinite being is the primary analogue for finite beings,
and the substance-mode of being for all accident-modes of being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Inasmuch, however, as being is not merely attributed to these
modes extrinsically, but belongs to all of them intrinsically, it is
also predicated of them by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">analogy of proportion</span></em>. This latter
sort of analogy is based on similarity of relations. For example,
the act of understanding bears a relation to the mind similar to
that which the act of seeing bears to the eye, and hence we say
of the mind that it <span class="tei tei-q">“sees”</span> things when it understands them. Or,
again, we speak of a verdant valley in the sunshine as <span class="tei tei-q">“smiling,”</span>
because its appearance bears a relation to the valley similar to
that which a smile bears to the human countenance. Or again,
we speak of the parched earth as <span class="tei tei-q">“thirsting”</span> for the rains, or of
the devout soul as <span class="tei tei-q">“thirsting”</span> for God, because these relations
are recognized as similar to that of a thirsty person towards the
drink for which he thirsts. In all such cases the analogical concept
implies not indeed the same attribute (differently realized) in
all the analogues (as in univocal predication) but rather a similarity
in the relation or proportion in which each analogue
embodies or realizes some attribute or attributes peculiar to itself.
Seeing is to the eye as understanding is to the mind; smiling is
to the countenance as the pleasing appearance of its natural
features is to the valley. Rain is to the parched earth, and God
is to the devout soul, as drink is to the thirsty person. It will be
noted that in all such cases the analogical concept is affirmed
primarily and properly of some one thing (the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">analogum princeps</span></span>),
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and of the other only secondarily, and relatively to the
former.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, if we reflect on the manner in which being is affirmed of
its various modes (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> of the infinite and the finite; or of substance
and accident; or of spiritual and corporeal substances;
or of quantities, or qualities, or causes, etc.) we can see <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">firstly</span></em>
that although these differ from one another <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by all that each of
them is, by the whole being of each</span></em>, yet there is an all-pervading
similarity between the relations which these modes bear each to
its own existence. All have, or can have, actual existence: each
according to the grade of perfection of its own reality. If we
conceive infinite being as the cause of all finite beings, then the
former exists in a manner appropriate to its all-perfect reality,
and finite beings in a manner proportionate to their limited
realities; and so of the various modes of finite being among
themselves. Moreover, we can see <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">secondly</span></em>, as will be explained
more fully below,<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> that being is affirmed of the finite by virtue
of its dependence on the infinite, and of accident by virtue of its
dependence on substance.<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> Being or reality is therefore predicated
of its modes by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">analogy of proportion</span></em>.<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Is a concept, when applied in this way, one, or is it really
manifold? It is not simply one, for this would yield univocal
predication; nor is it simply manifold, for this would give equivocal
predication. Being, considered in its vague, imperfect,
inadequate sense, as involving some common or similar proportion
or relation to existence in all its analogues, is one; considered
as representing clearly and adequately what is thus
similarly related to each of the analogues, it is manifold.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Analogy of proportion is the basis of the figure of speech
known as metaphor. It would be a mistake, however, to infer
from this that what is thus analogically predicated of a number
of things belongs intrinsically and properly only to one of them,
being transferred by a mere extrinsic denomination to the others;
and that therefore it does not express any genuine knowledge
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on our part about the nature of these other things. It does give
us real knowledge about them. Metaphor is not equivocation;
but perhaps more usually it is understood not to give us real
knowledge because it is understood to be based on resemblances
that are merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fanciful</span></em>, not real. Still, no matter how slender
and remote be the proportional resemblance on which the analogical
use of language is based, in so far forth as it has such a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> basis it gives us real insight into the nature of the analogues.
And if we hesitate to describe such a use of language as <span class="tei tei-q">“metaphorical,”</span>
this is only because <span class="tei tei-q">“metaphor”</span> perhaps too commonly
connotes a certain transferred and improper extension of the
meaning of terms, based upon a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purely fanciful</span></em> resemblance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All our language is primarily and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">properly</span></em> expressive of
concepts derived from the sensible appearances of material
realities. As applied to the suprasensible, intelligible aspects of
these realities, such as substance and cause, or to spiritual realities,
such as the human soul and God, it is analogical in another sense;
not as opposed to univocal, but as opposed to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proper</span></em>. That is,
it expresses concepts which are not formed directly from the
presence of the things which they signify, but are gathered from
other things to which the latter are necessarily related in a
variety of ways.<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> Considering the origin of our knowledge, the
material, the sensible, the phenomenal, comes first in order, and
moulds our concepts and language primarily to its own proper

the substantial, comes later, and must make use of the concepts
and language thus already moulded.

If we consider, however, not the order in which we get our

being or reality is primarily and more properly predicated
of the infinite than of the finite, of the Creator than of the
creature, of the spiritual than of the material, of substances than
of their accidents and sensible manifestations or phenomena.
Yet we do not predicate being or reality of the finite, or of
creatures, in a mere transferred, extrinsic, improper sense, as if
these were mere manifestations of the infinite, or mere effects of
the First Cause, to which alone reality would properly belong.

Thomists lay still greater stress, perhaps, upon the second consideration
referred to above, as a reason for regarding being as an analogical concept
when affirmed of Creator and creature, or of substance and accident: the
consideration that the finite is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">dependent</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> on the infinite, and accident on substance.
If being is realized in a true and proper sense, and intrinsically, as
it undoubtedly is, in whatever is distinguishable from nothingness, why not
say that we should affirm being or reality of all things </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">either as a genus in
the strict sense, or else in some sense not analogical but proper, after the
manner in which we predicate a genus of its species and individuals?... Since
the object of our universal idea of being is admitted to be really in all
things, we can evidently abstract from what is proper to substance and to
accident, just as we abstract from what is proper to plants and to animals
when we affirm of these that they are living things.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a>

the first place that the idea of being is in truth less analogical and more
proper than any belonging to the first sort of analogy [</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> of attribution], and
that therefore it approaches more closely to generic concepts properly so
called. At the same time the difference which separates both from the
latter concepts remains. For a name applied to many things is analogical if
what it signifies is realized </span><span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">par excellence</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> in one, and in the others only
subordinately and dependently on that. Hence it is that Aristotle regards
predication as analogical when something is affirmed of many things (1)
either because these have a certain relation to some one thing, (2) or because
they depend on some one thing. In the former case the thing signified by
the name is really and properly found only in one single thing, and is affirmed
of all the others only in virtue of some real relation of these to the former,
whether this be (</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">a</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">) that these things merely resemble that single thing

cause, etc. [metonymy]. In the latter case the thing signified by the name is
really in each of the things of which it is affirmed; but it is in one alone </span><span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">par
excellence</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, and in the others only by depending, for its very existence in
them, on that one. Now the object of the term </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">being</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> is found indeed in
accidents, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> in quantity, colour, shape; but certainly it must be applied
primarily to substance, and to accidents only dependently on the latter: for
quantity, colour, shape can have being only because the corporeal substance
possesses these determinations. But this is not at all the case with a genus and
its species. These differ from the genus, not by any such dependence, but
by the addition of some special perfection to the constituents of the genus;
for example, in the brute beast sensibility is added to vegetative life, and in
man intelligence is added to sensibility. Here there is no relation of
dependence for existence. Even if we considered human life as that of
which life is principally asserted, we could not say that plants and brute
beasts so depended for their life on the life of man that we could not affirm
life of them except as dependent on the life of man: as we cannot attribute
being to accidents except by reason of their dependence on substance.
Hence it is that we can consider apart, and in itself, life in
general, and attribute this to all living things without relating it to any other
being.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a>

affirm life primarily and principally, ought to be not human life, but absolute
life. And between this divine life and the life of all other beings there is a
relation of dependence, which reaches even to the very existence of life in
these other beings. In fact all life depends on the absolute life, not indeed
in the way accident depends on substance, but in a manner no less real and
far more excellent. This is entirely true; but what are we to conclude from
it if not precisely this, which scholasticism teaches: that the perfections
found in the various species of creatures can be affirmed of these in the
same sense (</span><span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">univocé</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">), but that they can be affirmed of God and creatures

<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">From all of which we can understand why it is that in regard to
genera and species the analogy is in the things but not in our thoughts, while in
regard to substance and accidents it is both in the things and in our thoughts:
a difference which rests not solely on our manner of conceiving things, nor
</span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">a fortiori</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> on mere caprice or fancy, but which has its basis in the very
nature of the things themselves. For though in the former case there is a
certain analogy in the things themselves, inasmuch as the same nature, that
of the genus, is realized in the species in different ways, still, as we have
seen, that is not sufficient, without the relation of dependence, to yield a basis
for analogy in our thoughts. For it is precisely because accident, as a
determination of substance, presupposes this latter, that being cannot be
affirmed of accident except as dependent on substance.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

These paragraphs will have shown with sufficient clearness why we should
regard being not as an univocal but as an analogical concept, when referred
to God and creatures, or to substance and accident. For the rest, the divergence
between the Scotist and the Thomist views is not very important, because
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">

The observations we have just been making in regard to the

3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Real Being and Logical Being.</span></span>—We may next illustrate
the notion of being by approaching it from another standpoint—by
examining a fundamental distinction which may be
drawn between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real being</span></em> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens reale</span></span>) and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical being</span></em> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We derive all our knowledge, through external and internal
sense perception, from the domain of actually existing things,
these things including our own selves and our own minds. We
form, from the data of sense-consciousness, by an intellectual
process proper, mental representations of an abstract and universal
character, which reveal to us partial aspects and phases of the
natures of things. We have no intuitive intellectual insight into
these natures. It is only by abstracting their various aspects, by
comparing these in judgments, and reaching still further aspects
by inferences, that we progress in our knowledge of things—gradually,
step by step, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">discursivé</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">discurrendo</span></span>. All this implies
reflection on, and comparison of, our own ideas, our mental views
of things. It involves the processes of defining and classifying,
affirming and denying, abstracting and generalizing, analysing
and synthesizing, comparing and relating in a variety of ways
the objects grasped by our thought. Now in all these complex
functions, by which alone the mind can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interpret rationally</span></em> what
is given to it, by which alone, in other words, it can know reality,
the mind necessarily and inevitably forms for itself (and expresses
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in intelligible language) a series of concepts which have for
their objects only the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modes</span></em> in which, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relations</span></em> by means
of which, it makes such gradual progress in its interpretation of
what is given to it, in its knowledge of the real. These concepts
are called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">secundae intentiones mentis</span></span>—concepts of the second
order, so to speak. And their objects, the modes and mutual
relations of our <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">primae intentiones</span></span> or direct concepts, are called
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span>—logical entities. For example, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstractness</span></em> is
a mode which affects not the reality which we apprehend intellectually,
but the concept by which we apprehend it. So, too, is
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universality</span></em> of a concept, its communicability or applicability
to an indefinite multitude of similar realities—the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">intentio universalitatis</span></span>,”</span>
as it is called—a mode of concept, not of the realities
represented by the latter. So, likewise, is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absence</span></em> of other
reality than that represented by the concept, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relative nothingness
or non-being</span></em> by contrast with which the concept is realized
as positive; and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute nothingness or non-being</span></em> which is
the logical correlative of the concept of being; and the static,
unchanging self-identity of the object as conceived in the abstract.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a>
These are not modes of reality <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as it is</span></em> but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as it is conceived</span></em>.
Again, the manifold logical relations which we establish
between our concepts—relations of (extensive or intensive) identity
or distinction, inclusion or inherence, etc.—are logical entities,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span>: relations of genus, species, differentia, proprium,
accidens; the affirmative or negative relation between predicate
and subject in judgment;<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> the mutual relations of antecedent
and consequent in inference. Now all these logical
entities, or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">objecta secundae intentionis mentis</span></span>, are relations established
by the mind itself between its own thoughts; they have,
no doubt, a foundation in the real objects of those thoughts as
well as in the constitution and limitations of the mind itself; but
they have themselves, and can have, no other being than that
which they have as products of thought. Their sole being consists
in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being thought of</span></em>. They are necessary creations or products of
the thought-process as this goes on in the human mind. We see
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that it is only by means of these relations we can progress in
understanding things. In the thought-process we cannot help
bringing them to light—and thinking them after the manner of
realities, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per modum entis</span></span>. Whatever we think we must think
through the concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span>; whatever we conceive we must
conceive as <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span>; but on reflection we easily see that such
entities as <span class="tei tei-q">“nothingness,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“negation or absence or privation of
being,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“universality,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“predicate”</span>—and, in general, all relations
established by our own thought between our own ideas representative
of reality—can have themselves no reality proper, no
actual or possible existence, other than that which they get from
the mind in virtue of its making them objects of its own thought.
Hence the scholastic definition of a logical entity or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span>
as <span class="tei tei-q">“that which has objective being merely in the intellect”</span>:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">illud quod habet esse objective tantum in intellectu, seu ... id
quod a ratione excogitatur ut ens, cum tamen in se entitatem non
habeat</span></span>”</span>.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> Of course the mental process by which we think such
entities, the mental state in which they are held in consciousness,
is just as real as any other mental process or state. But the
entity which is thus held in consciousness has and can have no
other reality than what it has by being an object of thought.
And this precisely is what distinguishes it from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real being</span></em>, from
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reality</span></em>; for the latter, besides the ideal existence it has in the
mind which thinks of it, has, or at least can have, a real existence
of its own, independently altogether of our thinking about it.
We assume here, of course—what is established elsewhere, as
against the subjective idealism of phenomenists and the objective
idealism of Berkeley—that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reality</span></em> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> things does not
consist in their being perceived or thought of, that their <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse</span></span>”</span>
is not <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">percipi</span></span>,”</span> that they have a reality other than and independent
of their actual presence to the thought of any human
mind. And even purely possible things, even the creatures of
our own fancy, the fictions of fable and romance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em>, absolutely
speaking and without any contradiction, have an existence in the
actual order, in addition to the mental existence they receive
from those who fancy them. Such entities, therefore, differ from
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span>; they, too, are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> beings.

must remember that the mind in knowing them, in interpreting them, in seeking
to penetrate the nature of them, is not purely passive; that reality as
known to us—or, in other words, our knowledge of reality—is the product of
a twofold factor: the subjective which is the mind, and the objective which
is the extramental reality acting on, and thus revealing itself to, the mind.
Hence it is that when we come to analyse in detail our knowledge of the
nature of things—or, in other words, the natures of things as revealed to our
minds—it will not be always easy to distinguish in each particular case the
properties, aspects, relations, distinctions, etc., which are </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">real</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> (in the sense of
being there in the reality independently of the consideration of the mind) from
those that are merely </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">logical</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> (in the sense of being produced and superadded

the very first importance to determine, as far as may be possible, to what
extent our knowledge of reality is not merely a mental </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">interpretation</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, but a
mental </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">construction</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, of the latter; and whether, if there be a constructive or
constitutive factor in thought, this should be regarded as interfering with
the validity of thought as representative of reality. This problem—of the
relation of the </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> to the </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">ens reale</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> in the process of cognition—has
given rise to discussions which, in modern times, have largely contributed to
the formation of that special branch of philosophical enquiry which is called
Epistemology. But it must not be imagined that this very problem was not
discussed, and very widely discussed, by philosophers long before the problem
of the validity of knowledge assumed the prominent place it has won for
itself in modern philosophy. Even a moderate familiarity with scholastic
philosophy will enable the student to recognize this problem, in a variety of
phases, in the discussions of the medieval schoolmen concerning the concepts
of matter and form, the simplicity and composition of beings, and the nature
of the various distinctions—whether logical, virtual, formal, or real—which
the mind either invents or detects in the realities it endeavours to understand
and explain.

4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Real Being and Ideal Being.</span></span>—The latter of these
expressions has a multiplicity of kindred meanings. We use it

of knowledge, an entity of whatsoever kind, whether real or
logical, must have in the mind of the knower in order that he
be aware of that entity. A mere logical entity, as we have seen,
has and can have no other mode of being than this which consists
in being an object of the mind's awareness. All real being,
too, when it becomes an object of any kind of human cognition
whatsoever—of intellectual thought, whether direct or reflex;
of sense perception, whether external or internal—must obtain
this sort of mental presence or mental existence: thereby alone
can it become an <span class="tei tei-q">“objectum <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cognitum</span></em>”</span>. Only by such mental

mirroring, or reproduction, or reconstruction, can reality become
so related and connected with mind as to reveal itself to mind.
Under this peculiar relation which we call cognition, the mind,
as we know from psychology and epistemology, is not passive:
if reality revealed itself immediately, as it is, to a purely passive
mind (were such conceivable), the existence of error would be
unaccountable; but the mind is not passive: under the influence
of the reality it forms the intellectual concept (the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">verbum mentale</span></span>),
or the sense percept (the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">species sensibilis expressa</span></span>), in and through
which, and by means of which, it attains to its knowledge of the

being, is that which exists or can exist extramentally, whether it
is known by the human mind or not, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> whether it exists also

We merely note these points here in order to indicate the errors involved in the
opposite contentions. Our concepts are characterized by abstractness, by a
consequent static immutability, by a plurality often resulting from purely mental
distinctions, by a universality which transcends those distinctions and unifies
the variety of all subordinate concepts in the widest concept of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">being</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. Now
if, for example, we attribute the unifying mental mode of universality to real
being, we must draw the pantheistic conclusion that all real being is one: the
logical outcome of extreme realism. If, again, we transfer purely mental
distinctions to the unity of the Absolute or Supreme Being, thus making
them real, we thereby deny infinite perfection to the most perfect being conceivable:
an error of which some catholic philosophers of the later middle
ages have been accused with some foundation. If, finally, we identify the

5. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fundamental Distinctions in Real Being.</span></span>—Leaving
logical and ideal being aside, and fixing our attention exclusively
on real being, we may indicate here a few of the most fundamental
distinctions which experience enables us to recognize in our study
of the universal order of things.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that which can be and that which actually is. For
a proper understanding of this distinction, which will be dealt
with presently, it is necessary to note here the following divisions
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> being, which will be studied in detail later on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Infinite Being and Finite Beings.</span></span>—All people have a
sufficiently clear notion of Infinite Being, or Infinitely Perfect
Being: though not all philosophers are agreed as to how precisely
we get this notion, or whether there actually exists such a
being, or whether if such being does exist we can attain to a
certain knowledge of such existence. By infinite being we mean
a being possessing all conceivable perfections in the most perfect
conceivable manner; and by finite beings all such beings as have
actually any conceivable limitation to their perfection. About
these nominal definitions there is no dispute; and scholasticism
identifies their respective objects with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">creatures</span></em>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Necessary Being and Contingent Beings.</span></span>—Necessary being
we conceive as that being which exists of necessity: being which
if conceived at all cannot be conceived as non-existent: being in
the very concept of which is essentially involved the concept of
actual existence: so that the attempt to conceive such being as
non-existent would be an attempt to conceive what would be
self-contradictory. Contingent being, on the other hand, is being
which is conceived not to exist of necessity: being which may
be conceived as not actually existent: being in the concept of
which is not involved the concept of actual existence. The same
observations apply to this distinction as to the preceding one.
It is obvious that any being which we regard as actual we must
regard either as necessary or as contingent; and, secondly, that
necessary being must be considered as absolutely independent,
as having its actual existence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from itself</span></em>, by its own nature;
while contingent being must be considered as dependent for its
actual existence on some being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em> than itself. Hence necessary
being is termed <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ens a se</span></span>, contingent being <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ens ab alio</span></span>.

the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“absolute”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“relative,”</span> as applied to being,
correspond roughly with the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“creatures”</span> in
the usage of theistic philosophers. But the former pair of terms
is really of wider application than the latter. The term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em>
means, etymologically, that which is loosed, unfettered, disengaged
or free from bonds (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutum</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ab-solvere</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">solvo</span></span> = <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">se-luo</span></span>, from
λύω): that, therefore, which is not bound up with anything else,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which is in some sense self-sufficing, independent; while the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relative</span></em> is that which is in some way bound up with something else,
and which is so far not self-sufficing or independent. That,
therefore, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ontologically</span></em> absolute which is in some sense self-sufficing,
independent of other things, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in its existence</span></em>; while
the ontologically relative is that which depends in some real way
for its existence on something else. Again, that is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logically</span></em>
absolute which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can be conceived and known by us without reference
to anything else</span></em>; while the logically relative is that which we
can conceive and know only through our knowledge of something
else. And since we usually name things according to the
way in which we conceive them, we regard as absolute any
being which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by itself</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of itself</span></em> that which we conceive it to
be, or that which its name implies; and as relative any being
which is what its name implies only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in virtue of some relation</span></em> to
something else.<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> Thus, a man is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></em> absolutely, while he is
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">friend</span></em> only relatively to others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is obvious that the primary and general meaning of the
terms <span class="tei tei-q">“absolute”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“relative”</span> can be applied and extended in
a variety of ways. For instance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> being may be said to be
<span class="tei tei-q">“relative”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to the knowing mind</span></em>, in the sense that all knowledge
involves a transcendental relation of the known object to the
knowing subject. In this widest and most improper sense even
God Himself is relative, not however as being, but as known.
Again, when we apply the same attribute to a variety of things
we may see that it is found in one of them in the most perfect
manner conceivable, or at least in a fuller and higher degree
than it is found in the others; and that it is found in these
others only with some sort of subordination to, and dependence
on, the former: we then say that it belongs to this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">primarily</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em>, and to the others only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">secondarily</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relatively</span></em>.
This is a less improper application of the terms than in the preceding
case. What we have especially to remember here is that
there are many different kinds of dependence or subordination,
all alike giving rise to the same usage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence, applying the terms absolute and relative to the predicate
<span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“real”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“reality,”</span> it is obvious in the first
place that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potential</span></em> as such can be called <span class="tei tei-q">“being,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“reality”</span>
only in relation to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em>. It is the actual that is
being <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">simpliciter</span></span>, <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">par excellence</span></span>; the potential is so only in

relation to this.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> Again, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substances</span></em> may be termed beings absolutely,
while <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidents</span></em> are beings only relatively, because of
their dependence on substances; though this relation is quite
different from the relation of potential to actual being. Finally
all finite, contingent realities, actual and possible, are what they
are only because of their dependence on the Infinite and Necessary
Being: and hence the former are relative and the latter
absolute; though here again the relation is different from that of
accident to substance, or of potential to actual.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since the order of being includes all orders, and since a being
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em> such-or-such in any order only when that being

that the being which realizes in all its fulness the reality of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em>
is the Absolute Being in the highest possible sense of this term.
This concept of Absolute Being is the richest and most comprehensive
of all possible concepts: it is the very antithesis of that
other concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“being in general”</span> which is common to everything
and distinguished only from nothingness. It includes in
itself all actual and possible modes and grades and perfections
of finite things, apart from their limitations, embodying all of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Static and the Changing.</span></span>—The things we see
around us, the things which make up the immediate data of our
experience, not only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exist</span></em>; they also <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">become</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">come</span></em> into
actual existence; they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em>; they pass out of actual existence.
The abstract notion of being represents its object to the mind in
a static, permanent, changeless, self-identical condition; but if
this condition were an adequate representation of reality change
would be unreal, would be only an illusion. This is what the
Eleatic philosophers of ancient Greece believed, distinguishing
merely between being and nothingness. But they were mistaken;
for change in things is too obviously real to be eliminated by
calling it an illusion: even if it were an illusion, this illusion at
least would have to be accounted for. In order, therefore, to
understand reality we must employ not merely the notion of
being (something <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">static</span></em>), but also the notion of becoming, change,
process, appearing and disappearing (something <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kinetic</span></em>, and
something <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dynamic</span></em>). In doing so, however, we must not fall
into the error of the opposite extreme from the Eleatics—by
regarding change as the adequate representation of reality. This
is what Heraclitus and the later Ionians did: holding that
nothing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>, that all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">becomes</span></em> (πάντα ρέι), that change is all reality,
that the stable, the permanent, is non-existent, unreal, an illusion.
This too is false; for change would be unintelligible without at
least an abiding <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law</span></em> of change, a permanent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principle</span></em> of some
sort; which, in turn, involves the reality of some sort of abiding,
stable, permanent being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must then—with Aristotle, as against both of those one-sided
conceptions—hold to the reality both of being and of
becoming; and proceed to see how the stable and the changing
can both be real.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To convince ourselves that they are both real, very little
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reflection is needed. We have actual experience of both those
elements of reality in our consciousness and memory of our own
selves. Every human individual in the enjoyment of his mental
faculties knows himself as an abiding, self-identical being, yet as
constantly undergoing real changes; so that throughout his life
he is really the same being, though just as certainly he really
changes. In external nature, too, we observe on the one hand
innumerable processes of growth and decay, of motion and
interaction; and on the other hand a similarly all-pervading
element of sameness or identity amid all this never-ending change.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Potential and the Actual.</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Possibility,
Absolute, Relative, and Adequate.</span></span>—It is from our experience
of actuality and change that we derive not only our notion
of temporal duration, but also our notion of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potential being</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possibility</span></em>, as distinct from that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual being</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actuality</span></em>. It
is from our experience of what actually exists that we are able to
determine what can, and what cannot exist. We know from experience
what gold is, and what a tower is; and that it is intrinsically
possible for a golden tower to exist, that such an object
of thought involves no contradiction, that therefore its existence
is not impossible, even though it may never actually exist as a
fact. Similarly, we know from experience what a square is, and
what a circle is; and that it is intrinsically impossible for a square
circle to exist, that such an object of thought involves a contradiction,
that therefore not only is such an object never actually
existent in fact, but that it is in no sense real, in no way possible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em> (or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metaphysical</span></em>)
possibility is the mere non-repugnance of an object of thought to
actual existence. Any being or object of thought that is conceivable
in this way, that can be conceived as capable of actually
existing, is called intrinsically (or objectively, absolutely, logically,
metaphysically) possible being. The absence of such intrinsic
capability of actual existence gives us the notion of the intrinsically
(objectively, absolutely, logically, metaphysically) impossible.
We shall return to these notions again. They are
necessary here for the understanding of real change in the actual
universe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fixing our attention now upon the real changes which characterize
the data of our experience, let us inquire what conditions
are necessary in order that an intrinsically possible object of
thought become here and now an actual being. It matters not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whether we select an example from the domain of organic nature,
of inorganic nature, or of art—whether it be an oak, or an iceberg,
or a statue. In order that there be here and now an actual
oak-tree, it is necessary not only (1) that such an object be intrinsically
possible, but (2) that there have been planted here an
actual acorn, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> an actual being having in it subjectively and
really the passive potentiality of developing into an actual oak-tree,
and (3) that there be in the actual things around the acorn
active powers or forces capable of so influencing the latent, passive
potentiality of the acorn as gradually to evolve the oak-tree therefrom.
So, too, for the (1) intrinsically possible iceberg, there are
needed (2) water capable of becoming ice, and (3) natural powers
or forces capable of forming it into ice and setting this adrift in
the ocean. And for the (1) intrinsically possible statue there are
needed (2) the block of marble or other material capable of becoming
a statue, and (3) the sculptor having the power to mould
this material into an actual statue.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In order, therefore, that a thing which is not now actual, but
only intrinsically or absolutely possible, become actual, there
must actually exist some being or beings endowed with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active
power or potency</span></em> of making this possible thing actual. The latter
is then said to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relatively, extrinsically</span></em> possible—in relation to
such being or beings. And obviously a thing may be possible
relatively to the power of one being, and not possible relatively
to lesser power of another being: the statue that is intrinsically
possible in the block of marble, may be extrinsically possible
relatively to the skilled sculptor, but not relatively to the unskilled
person who is not a sculptor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Furthermore, relatively to the same agent or agents, the production
of a given effect, the doing of a given thing, is said to be
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physically</span></em> possible if it can be brought about by such agents acting
according to the ordinary course of nature; if, in other words
they have the physical power to do it. Otherwise it is said to
be physically impossible, even though metaphysically or intrinsically
possible, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> it is physically impossible for a dead person to
come to life again. A thing is said to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morally</span></em> possible, in
reference to free and responsible agents, if they can do it without
unreasonable inconvenience; otherwise it is considered as morally
impossible, even though it be both physically and metaphysically
possible: as often happens in regard to the fulfilment of one's
obligations.

But all other power, all activity of created causes, does
require some such actually existing subject. If we examine
the activities of the agencies that fall within our direct experience,
whether in external nature or in our own selves, we shall
find that in no case does their operative influence or causality
extend beyond the production of changes in existing being, or
attain to the production of new actual being out of nothingness.

This consideration will help us to realize that all reality
which is produced by change, and subject to change, is essentially
a mixture of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">becoming</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em>, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potential</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em>.
The reality of such being is not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tota simul</span></span>. Only immutable
being, whose duration is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal</span></em>, has its reality <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tota simul</span></span>: it

one eternal <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em>,”</span> without beginning, end, or succession. But
mutable being, whose duration in actual existence is measured
by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em>, is actualized only successively: its actuality at any particular
instant does not embody the whole of its reality: this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
latter includes also a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em>”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will be</span></em>”</span>; the thing was
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potentially</span></em> what it now is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em>, and it will become actually
something which it now is only potentially; nor shall we have
understood even moderately the nature or essence of any mutable
being—an oak-tree, for example—until we have grasped the fact
that the whole reality of its nature embraces more than what we
find of it actually existing at any given instant of its existence.
In other words, we have to bear in mind that the reality of such
a being is not pure actuality but a mixture of potential and
actual: that it is an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus non-purus</span></span>, or an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus mixtus</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have to note well that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potential being</span></em> of a thing is
something <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>—that it is not merely a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">modus loquendi</span></span>, or a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">modus intelligendi</span></span>. The oak is in the acorn in some true and
real sense: the potentiality of the oak is something real in the
acorn: if it were not so, if it were nothing real in the acorn, we
could say with equal truth that a man or a horse or a house is
potentially in the acorn; or, again with equal truth, that the
oak is potentially in a mustard-seed, or a grain of corn, or a
pebble, or a drop of water. Therefore the oak is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> in the
acorn—not actually but potentially, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia passiva</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The oak-tree is also really in those <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active</span></em> forces of nature
whose influence on the acorn develop the latter into an actual
oak-tree: it is in those causes not actually, of course, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">virtually</span></em>,
for they possess in themselves the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">operative power</span></em>—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia
activa sive operativa</span></span>—to educe the oak-tree out of the acorn.
These two potential conditions of a being—in the active causes
which produce it, and in the pre-existing actual thing or things
from which it is produced—are called each a real or subjective
potency, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia realis</span></span>, or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia subjectiva</span></span>, in distinction from

And just as the passive potentiality of the statue is something
real in the block of marble, though distinct from the actuality of
the statue and from the process by which this is actualized, so is
the active power of making the statue something real in the

the statue. If an agent's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">power</span></em> to act, to produce change, were

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these correlatives, the notion underlying the term <span class="tei tei-q">“actual”</span>
is manifestly the notion of something completed, achieved,
perfected—as compared with that of something incomplete, imperfect,
determinable, which is the notion of the potential.
Hence the notions of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> have been extended
widely beyond their primary signification of power to act and the
exercise of this power. Such pairs of correlatives as the determinable
and the determined, the perfectible and the perfected,
the undeveloped or less developed and the more developed, the
generic and the specific, are all conceived under the aspect of
this widest relation of the potential to the actual. And since
we can distinguish successive stages in any process of development,
or an order of logical sequence among the contents of our
concept of any concrete reality, it follows that what will be conceived
as an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> in one relation will be conceived as a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia</span></span>
in another. Thus, the disposition of any faculty—as, for example,
the scientific habit in the intellect—is an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> or perfection of
the faculty regarded as a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia</span></span>; but it is itself a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia</span></span>
which is actualized in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">operation</span></em> of actually studying. This
illustrates the distinction commonly drawn between an <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus
primus</span></span>”</span> and an <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus secundus</span></span>”</span> in any particular order or line
of reality: the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus primus</span></span> is that which presupposes no prior
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
actuality in the same order; the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus secundus</span></span> is that which
does presuppose another. The act of knowing is an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus secundus</span></span>
which presupposes the cognitive faculty as an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus primus</span></span>:
the faculty being the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> or fundamental equipment of the soul
in relation to knowledge. Hence the child is said to have knowledge
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu primo</span></span>”</span> as having the faculty of reason; and the
student to have knowledge <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu secundo</span></span>”</span> as exercising this
faculty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> or perfecting principles of which we have spoken
so far are all conceived as presupposing an existing subject on
which they supervene. They are therefore <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidents</span></em> as distinct
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial constitutive</span></em> principles of this subject; and they
are therefore called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em> actualities, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">accidentales</span></span>”</span>.
But the actual existence of a being is also conceived as the complement
and correlative of its essence: as that which makes the
latter actual, thus transferring it from the state of mere possibility.
Hence existence also is called an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> or actuality: the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">existentialis</span></span>,”</span> to distinguish it from the existing thing's
activities and other subsequently acquired characters. In
reference to these existence is a <span class="tei tei-q">“first actuality”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Esse est actus

actuality”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“Action presupposes existence”</span>—while each of these
in reference to existence, is a <span class="tei tei-q">“second actuality,”</span> an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus secundus</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When, furthermore, we proceed to examine the constitutive
principles essential to any being in the concrete, we may be able
to distinguish between principles which are determinable, passive
and persistent throughout all essential change of that being,
and others which are determining, specifying, differentiating
principles. In water, for example, we may distinguish the
passive underlying principle which persists throughout the
decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen, from the
active specifying principle which gives that substratum its
specific nature as water. The former or material principle (ὕλη,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia</span></span>) is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potential</span></em>, compared with the latter or formal principle
(μορφή, εἶδος, ἐντελέχεια, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span>) as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em>.
The concept of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> is thus applied to the essence itself: the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">essentialis</span></span>”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formalis</span></span>”</span> of a thing is that which we
conceive to be the ultimate, completing and determining principle
of the essence or nature of that thing. In reference to this as
well as the other constitutive principles of the thing, the actual
existence of the thing is a <span class="tei tei-q">“second actuality,”</span> an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus secundus</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In fact all the constitutive principles of the essence of any existing
thing, and all the properties and attributes involved in the
essence or necessarily connected with the essence, must all alike
be conceived as logically antecedent to the existential <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span>
whereby they are constituted something in the actual order, and
not mere possible objects of our thought. And from this point
of view the existence of a thing is called the ultimate actualization
of its essence. Hence the scholastic aphorism: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Esse est

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The term <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> may designate that complement of reality by

In the latter sense
we have already distinguished the Being that is immutable, the
Being of God, as the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Actus Purus</span></span>, from the being of all mutable
things, which latter being is necessarily a mixture of potential

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now if the essences of corporeal things are composite, if they
are constituted by the union of some determining, formative
principle with a determinable, passive principle—of <span class="tei tei-q">“form”</span> with
<span class="tei tei-q">“matter,”</span> in scholastic terminology—we may call these formative
principles <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">informantes</span></span>”</span>; and if these cannot actually
exist except in union with a material principle they may be
called actus <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">non-subsistentes</span></span>”</span>: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, the formative principle or

spirits whose existence is known from revelation. Finally, there
may be a kind of actual essence which, though it naturally actualizes
a material principle <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span>, can nevertheless continue to
subsist without this latter: such an actual being would be at

Throughout all distinctions between the potential and the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The notion of grades of perfection in things is one with
which everyone is familiar. We naturally conceive some beings
as higher upon the scale of reality than others; as having <span class="tei tei-q">“more”</span>
reality, so to speak—not necessarily, of course, in the literal sense
of size or quantity—than others; as being more perfect, nobler,
of greater worth, value, dignity, excellence, than others. Thus
we regard the infinite as more perfect than the finite, spiritual
beings as nobler than material beings, man as a higher order of
being than the brute beast, this again as surpassing the whole
vegetable kingdom, the lowest form of life as higher on the scale
of being than inorganic matter, the substance-mode of being as
superior to all accident-modes, the actualized state of a being
as more perfect than its potential state, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> as existing in its
material, efficient and ideal or exemplar causes. The grounds
and significance of this mental appreciation of relative values in
things must be discussed elsewhere. We refer to it here in order
to point out another scholastic aphorism, according to which the
higher a thing is in the scale of actual being, and the more perfect
it is accordingly, the more efficient it will also be as a principle
of action, the more powerful as a cause in the production of
changes in other things, the more operative in actualizing their
passive potentialities; and conversely, the less actual a thing is,
and therefore the more imperfect, the greater its passive capacity
will be to undergo the influence of agencies that are actual and
operative around it. <span class="tei tei-q">“As passive potentiality,”</span> says St. Thomas,<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“is the mark of potential being, so active power is the mark of
actual being. For a thing acts, in so far as it is actual; but is
acted on, so far as it is potential.”</span> Our knowledge of the nature
of things is in fact exclusively based on our knowledge of their
activities: we have no other key to the knowledge of what a
thing is than our knowledge of what it does: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Operari sequitur

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A being that is active or operative in the production of a
change is said to be the efficient cause of the change, the latter
being termed the effect. Now the greater the change, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the
higher and more perfect be the grade of reality that is actualized
in the change, the higher too in the scale of being must be the
efficient cause of that change. There must be a proportion in
degree of perfection or reality between effect and cause. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
former cannot exceed in actual perfection the active power, and
therefore the actual being, of the latter. This is so because we
conceive the effect as being produced or actualized <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through the
operative influence</span></em> of the cause, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with real dependence</span></em> on this
latter; and it is inconceivable that a cause should have power to
actualize other being, distinct from itself, which would be of a
higher grade of excellence than itself. The nature of efficient
causality, of the influence by which the cause is related to its
effect, is not easy to determine; it will be discussed at a subsequent
stage of our investigations (ch. <a href="#Chapter_XI" class="tei tei-ref">xi.</a>); but whatever it be, a
little reflection should convince us of the truth of the principle
just stated: that an effect cannot be more perfect than its cause.
The mediæval scholastics embodied this truth in the formula:
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nemo dat quod non habet</span></span>—a formula which we must not interpret
in the more restricted and literal sense of the words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">giving</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">having</span></em>, lest we be met with the obvious objection that it is by
no means necessary for a boy to have a black eye himself in
order to give one to his neighbour! What the formula means
is that an agent cannot give to, or produce in, any potential
subject, receptive of its causal influence, an actuality which it
does not itself possess virtually, or in its active power: that no
actuality surpassing in excellence the actual perfection of the
cause itself can be found thus virtually in the active power of the
latter. There is no question of the cause or agent transferring
bodily as it were a part of its own actuality to the subject which
is undergoing change<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>; nor will such crude imagination images
help us to understand what real change, under the influence of
efficient causality, involves.<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> An analysis of change will enable
us to appreciate more fully the real difficulty of explaining it,
and the futility of any attempt to account for it without admitting
the real, objective validity of the notions of actual and potential
being, of active powers or forces and passive potentialities in the
things that are subject to change.

μεταβολή, κίνησις) is one of those simplest concepts which cannot
be defined. We may describe it, however, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the transition of a
being from one state to another</span></em>. If one thing entirely disappeared
and another were substituted for it, we should not regard the
former as having been changed into the latter. When one
thing is put in the place of another, each, no doubt, undergoes a
change of place, but neither is changed into the other. So, also,
if we were to conceive a thing as absolutely ceasing to exist, as
lapsing into nothingness at a given instant, and another as coming
into existence out of nothingness at the same instant (and in the
same place), we should not consider this double event as constituting
a real change of the former thing into the latter. And
although our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">senses</span></em> cannot testify to anything beyond <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sequence</span></em> in
sense phenomena, our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason</span></em> detects in real change something other
than a total substitution of things for one another, or continuous
total cessations and inceptions of existence in things. No doubt,
if we conceive the whole phenomenal or perceptible universe and all
the beings which constitute this universe as essentially contingent,
and therefore dependent for their reality and their actual existence
on a Supreme, Necessary Being who created and conserves them,
who at any time may cease to conserve any of them, and produce
other and new beings <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">out of nothingness</span></em>, then such absolute
cessations and inceptions of existence in the world would not be
impossible. God might <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">annihilate</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> cease to conserve in existence,
this or that contingent being at any instant, and at any
instant <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">create</span></em> a new contingent being, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> produce it in its totality
from no pre-existing material. But there is no reason to suppose
that this is what is constantly taking place in Nature: that all
change is simply a series of annihilations and creations. On the
contrary, the modes of being which appear and disappear in real
change, in the transition of anything from one state to a really
different state of being, do not appear <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de novo</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex nihilo</span></span>, as absolute
beginnings out of nothingness; or disappear <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">totaliter</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in nihilum</span></span>,
as absolute endings or lapses of reality into nothingness. The
real changes which take place in Nature are due to the operation
of natural causes. These causes, being finite in their operative
powers, cannot create, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> produce new being from nothingness.
They can, however, with the concurrence of the Omnipotent
Being, modify existing modes of being, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> make actual what was
only potential in these latter. The notion of change is not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
verified in the conception of successive annihilations and creations;
for there is involved in the former concept not merely the notion
of a real difference between the two <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> states, that before and
that after the change, but also the notion of some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potential</span></em> reality
persisting throughout the change, something capable of being actually
so and so before the change and actually otherwise after the
change. For real change, therefore, we require (1) two positive and
really different states of the same being, a <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">terminus a quo</span></span>”</span> and a
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">terminus ad quem</span></span>”</span>; and (2) a real process of transition whereby
something potential becomes actual. In creation there is no real
and positive <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">terminus a quo</span></span>; in annihilation there is no real and
positive <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">terminus ad quem</span></span>; these therefore are not changes in
the proper sense of the term. Sometimes, too, change is affirmed,
by purely extrinsic denomination, of a thing in which there is no
real change, but only a relation to some other really changing
thing. In this sense when an object unknown or unthought of
becomes the actual object of somebody's thought or cognition, it
is said to <span class="tei tei-q">“change,”</span> though the transition from <span class="tei tei-q">“unknown”</span> to
<span class="tei tei-q">“known”</span> involves no real change of state in the object, but only
in the knowing subject. If thought were in any true sense
<span class="tei tei-q">“constitutive”</span> of reality, as many modern philosophers contend,
the change in the object would of course be real.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since, therefore, change consists in this, that a thing which
is actually in a given state ceases to be actually such and begins
to be actually in another state, it is obvious that there persists
throughout the process some reality which is in itself potential
and indifferent to either actual state; and that, moreover, something
which was actual disappears, while some new actuality
appears, in this persisting potentiality. The abiding potential
principle is called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matter</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subject</span></em> of the change; the
transient actualizing principles are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forms</span></em>. Not all these
<span class="tei tei-q">“forms”</span> which precede or result from change are necessarily
positive entities in themselves: they may be mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">privations</span></em> of
other forms (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">privatio</span></span>,”</span> στέρησις): not all changes result in the
acquisition of a new degree of positive actual being; some result
in loss of perfection or actuality. Still, even in these cases, the
state characterized by the less perfect degree of actuality has a
determinate actual grade of being which is proper to itself, and
which, as such, is not found actually, but only potentially, in the
state characterized by the more perfect degree of actuality.
When, then, a being changes from a more perfect to a less
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
perfect state, the actuality of this less perfect state cannot be
adequately accounted for by seeking it in the antecedent and
more perfect state: it is not in this latter state <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em>, but only
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potentially</span></em>; nor do we account for it by saying that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“equivalently”</span>
in the greater actuality of the latter state: the two
actualizing principles are really distinct, and neither is wholly or
even partially the other. The significance of this consideration
will appear presently in connection with the scholastic axiom:
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quidquid movetur ab alio movetur</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Meanwhile we must guard against conceiving the potential
or material factor in change as a sort of actual but hidden core
of reality which itself persists unchanged throughout; and the
formative or actualizing factors as superficially adorning this
substratum by constantly replacing one another. Such a substitution
of imagination images for intellectual thought will not
help, but rather hinder, all accurate analysis. It is not the
potential or material factor in things that changes, nor yet the
actualizing or formal factors, but the things themselves; and if
<span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span> are subject to <span class="tei tei-q">“real change”</span> it is manifest that this
fact can be made intelligible, if at all, only by intellectually
analysing the things and their changes into constitutive principles
or factors which are nor themselves <span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“changes”</span>.
Were we to arrive only at principles of the latter sort, so far
from explaining anything we would really only have pushed
back the problem a step farther. It may be that none of the
attempts yet made by philosophers or scientists to offer an
ultimate explanation of change is entirely satisfactory,—the
scholastic explanation will be gradually outlined in these pages,—but
it will be of advantage at least to recognize the shortcomings
of theories that are certainly inadequate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are now in a position to state and explain the important
scholastic aphorism embodying what has been called the
Principle of Change (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Principium Motus</span></span>”</span>): <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quidquid movetur,
ab alio movetur</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whatever undergoes change is changed by
something else”</span>. The term <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motus</span></span> is here taken in the wide
sense of any real transition from potentiality to actuality, as is
evident from the alternative statements of the same principle:
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil potest seipsum reducere e potentia in actum</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing can
reduce itself from potentiality to actuality,”</span> or, again, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Potentia,
qua talis, nequit per semetipsam ad actum reduci, sed reducitur ab
alio principio in actu</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“The potential as such cannot be reduced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by itself to the actual, but only by some other already actual
principle”</span>.<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> This assertion, rightly understood, is self-evidently
true; for the state of passive potentiality, as such, involves the
absence of the correlative actuality in the potential subject; and
since the actual, as such, involves a perfection which is not in
the potential, the latter cannot confer upon itself this perfection:
nothing can be the adequate principle or source of a perfection
which is not in this principle or source: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nemo dat quod non habet</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have already anticipated the objection arising from the
consideration that the state resulting from a change is sometimes
in its totality less perfect than the state which existed prior to
the change. Even in such cases there results from the change a
new actuality which was not in the prior state, and which cannot
be conceived as a mere part or residue of the latter, or regarded
as equivalently contained in the latter. Even granting, as we
must, that the net result of such a change is a loss of actuality or
perfection in the subject of change, still there is always a gain
which is not accounted for by the loss; there is always a new
actual state which, as such, was not in the original state.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A more obvious objection to the principle arises from the
consideration of vital action; but it is based on a misunderstanding
of the principle under discussion. Living things, it is objected,
move themselves: their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vital</span></em> action is spontaneous and immanent:
originating within themselves, it has its term too within themselves,
resulting in their gradual development, growth, increase
of actuality and perfection. Therefore it would appear that they
move and perfect themselves; and hence the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“principle
of change”</span> is not true universally.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In reply to all this we admit that vital action is immanent,
remaining within the agent to perfect the latter; also that it is
spontaneous, inasmuch as when the agent is actually exercising
vital functions it need not be actually undergoing the causal
influence of any other created agent, or actually dependent on
any such agent. But it must, nevertheless, in such action, be
dependent on, and influenced by, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some actual being other than
itself</span></em>. And the reason is obvious: If by such action it increases
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its own actual perfection, and becomes actually other than it was
before such action, then it cannot have given itself the actuality
of this perfection, which it possessed before only potentially. No
doubt, it is not merely passively potential in regard to such actual
perfections, as is the case in non-vital change which results in the
subject from the transitive action of some outside cause upon the
latter. The living thing has the active power of causing or producing
in itself these actual perfections: there is interaction
between its vital parts: through one organ or faculty it acts upon
another, thus educing an actuality, a new perfection, in this
other, and thus developing and perfecting its own being. But
even considered as active it cannot be the adequate cause of the
actuality acquired through the change. If this actuality is something
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> over and above the reality of its active and passive
potential principles, then it remains true that change implies the
influence of an actual being other than the subject changed: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quid
quid movetur, ab alio movetur</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The question here arises, not only in reference to vital agents, but to </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">all
finite, created causes</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">: Does the active cause of change (together with the
passive potentiality of the subject of change, whether this subject be the
agent itself as in immanent activity, or something other than the agent as in
transitive activity),—does this active power account </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">adequately</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> for the new
actuality educed in the change? It obviously does not; for the actuality
acquired in the change is, as such, a new entity, a new perfection, in some
degree positively surpassing the total reality of the combined active powers
and passive potentialities which it replaces. In other words, if the actuality
resulting from the change is not to be found in the immediate active and
passive antecedents of the change, then we are inevitably referred, for an
adequate explanation of this actuality, to some actual being above and beyond
these antecedents. And to what sort of actual being are we referred? To a
being in which the actuality of the effect resides only in the same way as it
resides in the immediate active and passive antecedents of the change, that
is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">potentially</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">? No; for this would be useless, merely pushing the difficulty
one step farther back. We are obliged rather to infer the existence of an
Actual Being in whom the actuality of the said effect resides </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actually</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">: not
formally, of course, as it exists in itself when it is produced through the change;
but eminently, </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">eminenter</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, in such a way that its actualization outside Himself
and under His influence does not involve in Him any loss of perfection,
any increase of perfection, or any manner of change whatsoever. We are
compelled in this way to infer, from the existence of change in the universe
of our direct experience, the existence of a transcendent Immovable Prime
Mover, a </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Primum Movens Immobile</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. All the active causes or principles of
change which fall under our notice in the universe of direct experience are
themselves subject to change. None of them causes change in any other
thing without itself undergoing change. The active power of finite causes is
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
itself finite. By educing the potentiality of other things into actuality they
gradually use up their own energy; they diminish and lose their active power
of producing effects: this belongs to the very nature of finite causes as such.
Moreover, they are themselves passive as well as active; interaction is universal
among the finite causes which constitute the universe of our direct
experience: they all alike have passive potentiality and undergo change.
Now, if any one finite cause in this system cannot adequately account for the
new actuality evolved from the potential in any single process of change,
neither can the whole system adequately account for it. What is true of them
distributively is true of them taken all together when there is question of what
belongs to their nature; and the fact that their active powers and passive
potentialities </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">fall short</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of the actuality of the effects we attribute to them is
a fact that appertains to their very nature as finite things. The phenomenon
of continuous change in the universe involves the continuous appearance of
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">new actual being</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. To account for this constant stream of actuality we are
of necessity carried beyond the system of finite, changing being itself; we are
forced to infer the existence of a source and principle which must itself be
purely actual and exempt from all change—a Being who can cause all the
actuality that results from change without losing or gaining or changing in
any way Himself, because He possesses all finite actuality in Himself in a supereminent
manner which transcends all the efforts of finite human intelligence to
comprehend or characterize in any adequate or positive manner. The
scholastics expressed this in the simple aphorism: </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Omne novum ens est a Deo</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">If we must admit a causal influence of these things [of direct experience]
on one another, then a closer examination will convince us that a finite
thing can never be the adequate cause of any effect, but is always, metaphysically
regarded, only a part-cause, ever needing to be completed by
another cause. Every effect is—at least under one aspect, at least as an
effect—something new, something that was not there before. Even were the
effect contained, whether formally or virtually, in the cause, it is certainly not
identical with this latter, for if it were there would be no causality, nothing
would </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">happen</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. In all causing and happening, something which was heretofore
only possible, becomes real and actual. But things cannot determine
themselves to influence others, or to receive the influence of others, since they
are not dependent in their being on one another. Hence the necessary
inference that all being, all happening, all change, requires the concurrence
of an Absolute Principle of being. When two things act on each other the
Absolute Being must work in and with them, the same Absolute Being in
both—to relate them to each other, and supplement their natural insufficiency.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

can be actualized only by the action of some already actual being.
Nor can we avoid this consequence by supposing the
potential being to have had no actual beginning in time, but to be
eternally in process of actualization; for even so, it must be eternally
actualized <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by some other actual being</span></em>—a position which Aristotle
and some scholastics admit to be possible. Whether, then, we conceive
the actualization as beginning in time or as proceeding from
all eternity, it is self-contradictory to suppose the potential as
capable of actualizing itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is likewise true that the actual precedes the possible <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the
order of our knowledge</span></em>. The concept of a thing as possible presupposes
the concept of that thing as actual; for the possible is
understood to be possible only by its intelligible relation to actual
existence. This is evidently true of extrinsic possibility; but our
knowledge even of the intrinsic possibility of a thing cannot be
the first knowledge we possess in the order of time. Our first
knowledge is of the actual; for the mind's first cognitive act
must have for object either itself or something not itself. But it
knows itself as a consciously acting and therefore actual being.
And it comes to know things other than itself only by the fact
that such other things act upon it either immediately or mediately
through sense-consciousness; so that in every hypothesis its first
known object is something actual.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a>

The priority of the actual as compared with the potential in the real
order, suggests a proof of the existence of God in the manner indicated
above. It also affords a refutation of Hegelian monism. The conception
of the world, including all the phenomena of mind and matter, as the gradual
self-manifestation or evolution of a potential being eternally actualizing itself,
is a self-contradictory conception. Scholastics rightly maintain that the
realities from which we derive our first most abstract and transcendental
notion of being in general, are actual realities. Hegelians seize on the object
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
of this notion, identify it with pure thought, proclaim it the sole reality, and
endow it with the power of becoming actually everything. It is manifest,
therefore, that they endow purely potential being with the power of actualizing
itself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Nor can they fairly avoid this charge by pointing out that although their
starting-point is not actual being (with which the scholastic philosophy of
being commences), yet neither is it possible or potential being, but being
which has neither of these determinations, being which abstracts from both,
like the real being of the scholastics (7, 13). For though real being can
be </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">an object of abstract human thought</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> without either of the predicates </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">existent</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">

either of them. There it must be either actually existent or else merely
potential. But Hegelians claim absolutely indeterminate being to be </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">as such</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
something in the real order; and though they try to distinguish it from potential
being they nevertheless think of it as potential being, for they distinctly and repeatedly
declare that it can become all things, and does become all things, and
is constantly, eternally transforming itself by an internal dialectic process into the
phenomena which constitute the worlds of mind and matter. Contrasting it with
the abstract </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">inert</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> being which they conceive to be the object of the traditional

11. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Kinds of Change.</span></span>—Following Aristotle,<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> we may recognize
a broad and clear distinction between four great classes
of change (μεταβολή, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mutatio</span></span>) in the phenomena of our sense
experience: local change (κίνησις κατὰ τόπον, φορά, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">latio</span></span>);
quantitative change (κατὰ τὸ πόσον, ἀύζησις ἤ φθίσις, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">augmentatio
vel diminutio</span></span>); qualitative change (κατὰ τὸ ποίον, ἀλλοίωσις,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">alteratio</span></span>); and substantial change (κατ᾽ οὐσίαν, γένεσις ἤ φθορά).
The three former are accidental, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> do not reach or affect the
essence or substance of the thing that is changed; the fourth is
substantial, a change of essence. Substantial change is regarded
as taking place instantaneously, as soon as the condition brought
about by the accidental changes leading up to it becomes
naturally incompatible with the essence or nature of the subject.
The accidental changes, on the other hand, are regarded as taking
place gradually, as realizing and involving a succession of states
or conditions in the subject. These changes, especially when
they take place in corporeal things, are properly described as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
movement or motion (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motus</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motio</span></span>). By movement or motion in
the strict sense we therefore mean any change which takes place
gradually or successively in a corporeal thing. It is only in a
wider and improper sense that these terms are sometimes applied
to activity of whatsoever kind, even of spiritual beings. In this
sense we speak of thoughts, volitions, etc., as movements of the
soul, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motus animae</span></span>; or of God as the Prime Mover ever in motion,
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Primum Movens semper in motu</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With local change in material things, as also with quantitative
change, growth and diminution of quantity (mass and volume),
everyone is perfectly familiar. From the earliest times, moreover,
we find both in science and philosophy the conception of
matter as composed of, and divisible into, ultimate particles,
themselves supposed to admit of no further real division, and
hence called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">atoms</span></em> (ἄ-τομος, τέμνω). From the days of Grecian
atomism men have attempted to show that all change in the
Universe is ultimately reducible to changes of place, order,
spatial arrangement and collocation, of those hypothetical
atomic factors. It has likewise been commonly assumed that
change in mass is solely due to change in the number of
those atoms, and change in volume (of the same mass) to the
relative density or closeness with which the atoms aggregate
together; though some have held—and it is certainly not inconceivable—that
exactly the same material entity, an atom let us
say, may be capable of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> contraction and expansion, and so
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> change of volume: as distinct from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apparent</span></em> contraction
and expansion of bodies, a change which is supposed to be
due to change of density, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> to decrease or increase in the
dimensions of the pores or interstices between the smaller constituent
parts or molecules. However this may be, the attempts
to reduce all change in physical nature to mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mechanical</span></em> change
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> to spatial motions of the masses (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">molar</span></em> motions), the molecules
(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">molecular</span></em> motions), and the atoms or other ultimate components
of matter (whether vibratory, undulatory, rotatory or
translational motions), have never been satisfactory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Qualitative change is wider than material change, for it includes
changes in spiritual beings, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> in beings which are outside
the category of quantity and have a mode of existence altogether
different from the extensional, spatial existence which characterizes
matter. When, for instance, the human mind acquires knowledge,
it undergoes qualitative change. But matter, too, has qualities,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and is subject to qualitative change. It is endowed with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active</span></em>
qualities, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> with powers, forces, energies, whereby it can not
merely perform mechanical work by producing local changes in
the distribution of its mass throughout space, but also produce
physical and chemical changes which seem at least to be different
in their nature from mere mechanical changes. It is likewise
endowed with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive</span></em> qualities which appear to the senses to be
of various kinds, differing from one another and from the
mechanical or quantitative characteristics of size, shape, motion,
rest, etc. While these latter are called <span class="tei tei-q">“primary qualities”</span> of
bodies—because conceived to be more fundamental and more
closely inherent in the real and objective nature of matter—or
<span class="tei tei-q">“common sensibles”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensibilia communia</span></span>), because perceptible
by more than one of our external senses—the former are called
<span class="tei tei-q">“secondary qualities,”</span> because conceived to be less characteristic
of the real and objective nature of matter, and more largely subjective
products of our own sentient cognitive activity—or <span class="tei tei-q">“proper
sensibles”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensibilia propria</span></span>), because each of them is apprehended
by only one of our external senses: colour, sound, taste, odour,
temperature, material state or texture (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> roughness, liquidity,
softness, etc.). Now about all these perceived qualities and their
changes the question has been raised: Are they, as such, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> as
perceived by us, really in the material things or bodies which
make up the physical universe, and really different in these
bodies from the quantitative factors and motions of the latter?
Or, as such, are they not rather partially or wholly subjective
phenomena—products, at least in part, of our own sense perception,
states of our own consciousness, having nothing really
corresponding to them in the external matter of the universe
beyond the quantitative, mechanical factors and motions whereby
matter acts upon our faculties of sense cognition and produces
these states of consciousness in us? This is a question of the
first importance, the solution of which belongs to Epistemology.
Aristotle would not allow that the objective material universe
can be denuded, in the way just suggested, of qualities and
qualitative change; and scholastic philosophers have always
held the same general view. What we have to note here, however,
in regard to the question is simply this, that even if the
world of matter were thus simplified by transferring all qualitative
change to the subjective domain of consciousness, the reality of
qualitative change and all the problems arising from it would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
still persist. To transfer qualitative change from object to subject,
from matter to mind, is certainly something very different
from explaining it as reducible to quantitative or mechanical
change. The simplification thus effected would be more apparent
than real: it would be simplifying the world of matter by transferring
its complexity to the world of mind. This consideration
is one which is sometimes lost sight of by scientists who advance
mechanical hypotheses as ultimate explanations of the nature
and activities of the physical universe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If all material things and processes could be ultimately
analysed into configurations and local motions of space-occupying
atoms, homogeneous in nature and differing only in size and
shape, then each of these ultimate atomic factors would be itself
exempt from intrinsic change as to its own essence and individuality.
In this hypothesis there would be really no such
thing as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em> change. The collection of atoms would form
an immutable core of material reality, wholly simple and ever
actual. Such an hypothesis, however, is utterly inadequate as
an explanation of the facts of life and consciousness. And even
as an account of the processes of the inorganic universe it encounters
insuperable difficulties. The common belief of men has
always been that even in this domain of reality there are fundamentally
different <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kinds</span></em> of matter, kinds which differ from one
another not merely in the shape and size and configuration and
arrangement of their ultimate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> constituents, but even in the
very substance or nature of these constituents; and that there
are some material changes which affect the actual substance
itself of the matter which undergoes them. This belief scholastics,
again following Aristotle, hold to be a correct belief, and one
which is well grounded in reason. And this belief in turn involves
the view that every type of actual material entity—whether
merely inorganic, or endowed with life, or even allied with a
higher, spiritual mode of being as in the case of man himself—is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essentially composite</span></em>, essentially a synthesis of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potential</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em>
principles of being, and therefore capable of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em> change.
The actually existing material being scholastics describe as
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia secunda</span></span>, the ὕλη ἐσχάτη of Aristotle; the purely potential
factor, which is actualized in this or that particular kind of matter,
they describe as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia prima</span></span>, the ὕλη πρώτη of Aristotle; the
actualizing, specifying, formative principle, they designate as
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span> (εἶδος). And since the purely potential principle
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cannot actually exist except as actualized by some formative
principle, all substantial change or transition from one substantial
type to another is necessarily both a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">corruptio</span></span> and a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generatio</span></span>.
That is, it involves the actual disappearance of one substantial
form and the actual appearance of another. Hence the scholastic
aphorism regarding substantial change: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Corruptio unius est generatio
alterius</span></span>: the corruption or destruction of one kind of
material thing involves the generation of another kind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The concepts of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia prima</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span> are
concepts not of phenomenal entities directly accessible to the
senses or the imagination, but of principles which can be reached
only mediately and by intellect proper. They cannot be pictured
in the imagination, which can only attain to the sensible. We
may help ourselves to grasp them intellectually by the analogy
of the shapeless block of marble and the figure educed therefrom
by the sculptor, but this is only an analogy: just as the
statue results from the union of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em> form with an
existing matter, so this matter itself, the substance <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">marble</span></em>, is
composed of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em> form and a primordial, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potential</span></em> matter.
But there the analogy ceases.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Furthermore, when we consider that the proper and primary
objects of the human intellect itself are corporeal things or bodies,
and that these bodies actually exist in nature only as composite
substances, subject to essential or substantial change, we shall
realize why it is that the concept of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia prima</span></span> especially,
being a mediate and negative concept, is so difficult to grasp;
for, as the scholastics describe it, translating Aristotle's formula,
it is in itself <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">neque quid, neque quantum, neque quale, neque aliquid
eorum quibus ens determinatur</span></span>.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> But it is through intellectual
concepts alone, and not through imagination images, that we
may hope to analyse the nature and processes even of the world
of corporeal reality; and, as St. Thomas well observes, it was
because the ancient Greek atomists did not rise above the level
of thinking in imagination images that they failed to recognize
the existence, or explain the nature, of substantial change in the
material universe<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a>: an observation which applies with equal

would fain reduce all physical processes to mere mechanical
change.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those, then, are the principal kinds of change, as analysed
by Aristotle and the scholastics. We may note, finally, that the
distinction between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immanent</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transitive</span></em> activity is also applied
to change—that is, to change considered as a process, not
to the result of the change, to change <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in fieri</span></span>, not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in facto esse</span></span>. Immanent
movement or activity (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motio</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio immanens</span></span>) is that of which
the term, the educed actuality, remains within the agent—which
latter is therefore at once both <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">agens</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">patiens</span></span>. Vital action is
of this kind. Transitive movement or activity, on the other
hand (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motio</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio transiens</span></span>), is that of which the term is some
actuality educed in a being other than the agent. The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">patiens</span></span> is
here really distinct from the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">agens</span></span>; and it is in the former, not
in the latter, that the change takes place: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio fit in passo</span></span>. All
change in the inorganic universe is of this sort (<a href="#Section_101" class="tei tei-ref">101</a>).

own, can be known only through its ideal presence in his mind,
through the concept or percept whereby it becomes for him a
<span class="tei tei-q">“known object,”</span> an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">objectum cognitum</span></span>. But this actual presence
of known being to the knowing mind must not be confounded
with the real existence of such being (4). Real being does not get
its real existence in our minds or from our minds. Our cognition
does not produce, but only discovers, actually existing reality.
The latter, by acting on the mind, engenders therein the cognition
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of itself. Now all our knowledge comes through the senses;
and sense cognition is excited in us by the direct action of
material or phenomenal being on our sense faculties. But
through sense cognition the mind is able to attain to a knowledge
both of the possibility and of the actual existence of suprasensible
or spiritual realities. Hence we cannot describe existence as the
power which material realities have to excite in us a knowledge
of themselves. Their existence is prior to this activity: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">prius est
esse quam agere</span></span>. Nor can we limit existence to material realities;
for if there are spiritual realities these too have existence, though
this existence can be discerned only by intellect, and not by
sense.

we understand it only by degrees; we explore it from various

it: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ratio humana essentias rerum quasi venatur</span></span>, as the scholastics
say: the human mind hunts, as it were, after the essences or
natures of things. Understanding the individual datum of sense
experience (what Aristotle called τόδε τι, or οὐσία πρώτη, and
the scholastics <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">hoc aliquid</span></span>, or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">substantia prima</span></span>), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> this individual,
Socrates, first under the vaguest concept of being, then gradually
under the more and more determinate concepts of substance,
corporeal, living, sentient, rational, it finally forms the complex
concept of his <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">species infima</span></span>, expressed by his lowest class-name,
<span class="tei tei-q">“man,”</span> and explicitly set forth in the definition of his specific
nature as a <span class="tei tei-q">“rational animal”</span>. Nor does our reason fail to
realize that by reaching this concept of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specific</span></em> essence or
nature of the individual, Socrates, it has not yet grasped all the
reality whereby the individual is what he is. It has reached
what he has in common with all other individuals of his class,
what is essential to him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a man</span></em>; it has distinguished this from
the unanalysed something which makes him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this particular individual</span></em>
of his class, and which makes his specific essence this
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individual essence</span></em> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">essentia</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">atoma</span></span>,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">individua</span></span>”</span>); and it has
also distinguished his essence from those accidental and ever
varying attributes which are not essential to him as a man,
and from those which are not essential to him as Socrates.
It is only the unfathomed individual essence, as existing <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">hic et
nunc</span></span>, that is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concrete</span></em>. All the mind's generic and specific representations
of it—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> of Socrates as a corporeal substance, a
living being, a sentient being, a rational animal—are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstract</span></em>,
and all more or less inadequate, none of them exhausting its
knowable reality. But it is only in so far as the mind is able to
represent concrete individual things by such abstract concepts,
that it can attain to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellectual</span></em> knowledge of their nature or
reality. Hence it is that by the term <span class="tei tei-q">“essence,”</span> simply and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sine
addito</span></span>, we always mean the essence as grasped by abstract
generic or specific concepts (ἔιδος, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>), and as thus capable of
definition (λόγος, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ratio rei</span></span>). <span class="tei tei-q">“The essence,”</span> says St. Thomas,

gives the specific or generic type to which the individual thing
belongs; but we may also mean by essence, the concrete essence,
the individual person or thing (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">persona</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">suppositum</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">res individua</span></span>).
The relations between the objects of those two concepts of essence
will be examined later.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since the specific essence is conceived as the most fundamental
reality in the thing, and as the seat and source of all the
properties and activities of the thing, it is sometimes defined or
described, in accordance with this notion of it, as the primary
constitutive of the thing and the source of all the properties of
the thing. Conceived as the foundation of all the properties of
the thing it is sometimes called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em> (οὐσία, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">substantia</span></span>).
Regarded as the source of the thing's activities, and the principle
of its growth or development, it is called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of the thing
(φύσις, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura</span></span>, from φύω, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nascor</span></span>).<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since what makes a thing that which it is, by the same fact
differentiates this thing from every other thing, the essence is
rightly conceived as that which gives the thing its characteristic
being, thereby marking it off from all other being. In reality,
of course, each individual being is distinct by all that it is from
every other. But since we get our intellectual knowledge of
things by abstracting, comparing, generalizing, and classifying
partial aspects of them, we apprehend part of the imperfectly
grasped abstract essence of each individual as common to other
classes (generic), and part as peculiar to that class itself (differential);
and thus we differentiate classes of things by what is only
part of their essence, by what we call the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia</span></span> of each class,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinguishing mentally</span></em> between it and the generic element:
which two are really <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>, really identical, in every individual of
the species thus defined and classified.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in the Aristotelian and scholastic view of the constitution
of any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corporeal</span></em> thing, there is a danger of taking what is really
only part of the essence of such a thing for the whole essence.
According to this view all corporeal substance is essentially composite,
constituted by two really distinct, substantial principles,
primal matter (πρώτη ὕλη, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia prima</span></span>) and substantial form
(ἔιδος, μορφή) united substantially, as potential and actual principles,
to form one composite nature or essence. Now the kind,
or species, or specific type, to which a body belongs—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, a horse,
an oak, gold, water, etc.—depends upon the substantial form which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
actualizes the matter or potential principle. In so far as the
corporeal essence is known to us at all it is known through the
form, which is the principle of all the characteristic properties and
activities of that particular kind of body. Hence it is quite natural
that the εἲδος, μόρφη, or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span> of a body should
often be referred to as the specific essence of the body, though of
course the essence of the body really includes the material as well
as the formal factor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may look at the essence of any being from two points of
view. If we consider it as it is conceived actually to exist in the
being, we call it the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical essence</span></em>. If we consider it after the
manner in which it is apprehended and defined by our intellects
through generic and differentiating concepts, we call it the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metaphysical
essence</span></em>. Thus, the essence of man conceived by the two
defining concepts, <span class="tei tei-q">“rational animal,”</span> is the metaphysical essence;
the essence of man as known to be composed of the two really
distinct substantial principles, soul and body, is the physical essence.
Understood in this way both are one and the same essence
considered from different points of view—as existing in the actual
order, and as conceived by the mind.<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The physical essence of any being, understood as the constitutive
principle or principles from which all properties spring,
is either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simple</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">composite</span></em> according as it is understood to consist
of one such constitutive principle, or to result from the substantial
union of two constitutive principles, a material and a
formal. Thus, the essence of God, the essence of a purely
spiritual being, the essence of the human soul, are physically
simple; the essence of man, the essences of all corporeal beings,
are physically composite.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to our mode of conceiving, defining and classifying
essences by means of the abstract generic and differential grades of
being which we apprehend in them, all essences, even physically
simple essences, are conceived as logically and metaphysically composite.
Moreover we speak and think of their generic and differential
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
factors as <span class="tei tei-q">“material”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“formal”</span> respectively, after the
analogy of the composition of corporeal or physically composite
essences from the union of two really distinct principles, matter
and form; the analogy consisting in this, that as matter is the
indeterminate principle which is determined and actuated by form,
so the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generic</span></em> concept is the indeterminate concept which is made
definite and specific by that of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia</span></span>.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> But when we
think of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span> of any corporeal essence as <span class="tei tei-q">“material,”</span> and the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia</span></span> as <span class="tei tei-q">“formal,”</span> we must not consider these <span class="tei tei-q">“metaphysical
parts”</span> as really distinct; whereas the <span class="tei tei-q">“physical parts”</span> of a
corporeal substance (such as man) are really distinct. The
genus (animal), although a metaphysical part, expresses the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole essence</span></em> (man) in an indeterminate way; whereas the
<span class="tei tei-q">“matter”</span> which is a physical part, does not express the whole
essence of man, nor does the soul which is also a physical part,
but only both together. Not a little error has resulted from the
confusion of thought whereby <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia</span></span> have been
regarded as material and formal constitutives in the literal sense
of those expressions.

14. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Characteristics of Abstract Essences.</span></span>—When we
consider the essences of things not as actually existing, but as
intrinsically possible—the abstract, metaphysical essences, therefore—we
find that when as objects of our thought they are
analysed into their simplest constituents and compared or
related with themselves and with one another they present
themselves to our minds in these relations as endowed with
certain more or less remarkable characteristics.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) In the first place, being abstract, they present themselves
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the mind as being what they are independently of actual
existence at any particular time or place. Their intelligibility is
something apart from any relation to any actual time or place.
Being intrinsically possible, they might exist at any time or
place; but as possible, they are out of time and out of place—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">detemporalized</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">delocalized</span></em>, if we may be permitted to use

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Furthermore, since the intellect forms its notions of them,
through the aid of the senses and the imagination, from actual
realizations of themselves or their constituent factors, and since
it understands them to be intrinsically possible, or free from
intrinsic incompatibility of their constituent factors, it conceives
them to be capable of indefinitely repeated actualizations throughout
time and space—unless it sees some special reason to the
contrary, as it does in the case of the Necessary Being, and
(according to some philosophers) in the case of purely immaterial
beings or pure spirits. That is to say it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universalizes</span></em> them, and
sees them to be capable of existing at any and every conceivable
time and place. This relation of theirs to space is not likely to
be confounded with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immensity</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ubiquity</span></em> of God. But
their corresponding relation to time is sometimes described as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternity</span></em>; and if it is so described it must be carefully distinguished
from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positive</span></em> eternity of God, the Immutable Being. To
distinguish it from the latter it is usually described as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">negative</span></em>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Thirdly, essences considered apart from their actual existence,
and compared with their own constitutive factors or with
one another, reveal to the mind relations which the mind sees to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em>, and which it formulates for itself in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em> judgments,—judgments
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in materia necessaria</span></span>. By virtue of the
principle of identity an abstract essence is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em> what it is,
what the mind conceives it to be, what the mind conceives as its
definition. Man, as an object of thought, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em> a rational
animal, whether he actually exists or not. And if he is thought
of as existing, he cannot at the same time be thought of as non-existing,—by
the principle of contradiction. An existing man is
necessarily an existing man,—by the principle of identity. These
logical principles are rooted in the nature of reality, whether
actual or possible, considered as an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object of thought</span></em>. There is thus
a necessary relation between any complex object of thought and
each of the constituent factors into which the mind can analyse
it. And, similarly, there is a necessary negative relation—a
relation of exclusion—between any object of thought and anything
which the mind sees to be incompatible with that object as a
whole, or with any of its constituent factors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, the mind sees necessary relations between abstract
essences compared with one another. Five and seven are
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em> twelve. Whatever begins to exist actually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> have
a cause. Contingent being, if such exists, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em> dependent
for its existence on some other actually existing being. If
potential being is actualized it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> be actualized by actual being.
The three interior angles of a triangle are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em> equal to two
right angles. And so on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But is the abstract essence itself—apart from all mental
analysis of it, apart from all comparison of it with its constituent
factors or with other essences—in any sense <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em>? There is
no question of its actual existence, but only of itself as an object of
thought. Now our thought does not seem to demand <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em>,
or have a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em> connexion with, any particular object of which
we do <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> think. What we do think of is determined by our
experience of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> things. And the things which we conceive
to be possible, by the exercise of our reason upon the data of our
senses, memory and imagination, are determined as to their
nature and number by our experience of actual things, even
although they themselves can and do pass beyond the domain of
actually experienced things. The only necessary object of
thought is reality in general: for the exercise of the function of
thought necessarily demands an object, and this object must be
reality of some sort. Thought, as we saw, begins with actual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reality. Working upon this, thought apprehends in it the foundations
of those necessary relations and judgments already referred
to. Considering, moreover, the actual data of experience, our
thought can infer from these the actual existence of one Being
Who must exist by a necessity of His Essence.

15. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Grounds of Those Characteristics.</span></span>—In considering
the grounds or reasons of the various characteristics just enumerated
it may be well to reflect that when we speak of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic possibility</span></em> of a possible essence we conceive the latter as
something complex, which we mentally resolve into its constitutive
notes or factors or principles, to see if these are compatible.
If they are we pronounce the essence intrinsically
possible, if not we pronounce it intrinsically impossible. For
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
our minds, absence of internal incompatibility in the content
of our concept of any object is the test of its intrinsic possibility.
Whatever fulfils this test we consider capable of existing.
But what about the possibility of the notes, or factors,
or principles themselves, whereby we define those essences, and
by the union of which we conceive those essences to be constituted?
How do we know that those abstract principles or
factors—no one of which can actually exist alone, since all are
abstract—can in certain combinations form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possible</span></em> objects of
thought? We can know this only because we have either experienced
such objects as actual, or because we infer their possibility
from objects actually experienced. And similarly our
knowledge of what is impossible is based upon our experience of
the actual. Since, moreover, our experience of the actual is
finite and fallible, we may err in our judgments as to what essences
are, and what are not, intrinsically possible.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If now we ask ourselves what intelligible reason can we
assign for the characteristics just indicated as belonging to possible
essences, we must fix our attention first of all on the fundamental
fact that the human intellect always apprehends its object <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in an
abstract condition</span></em>. It contemplates the essence apart from the
existence in which the essence is subject to circumstances of time
and place and change; it grasps the essence in a static condition
as simply identical with itself and distinct from all else; it sees
the essence as indifferent to existence at any place or time;
reflecting then on the actualization of this essence in the existing
order of things, it apprehends the essence as capable of indefinite
actualizations (except in cases where it sees some reason to
the contrary), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universalizes</span></em> the essence; comparing it with
its constituent notes or elements, and with those of other essences,
it sees and affirms certain relations (of identity or diversity, compatibility
or incompatibility, between those notes or elements) as
holding good <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immutably</span></em>, and independently of
the actual embodiment of those notes or elements in any object
existing at any particular place or time. All these features of
the relations between the constituents of abstract, possible
essences, seem so far to be adequately accounted for by the fact
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the intellect apprehends those essences <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the abstract</span></em>: the
data in which it apprehends them being given to it through
sense experience. What may be inferred from the fact that the
human intellect has this power of abstract thought, is another
question<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a>. But granting that it does apprehend essences in
this manner, we seem to have in this fact a sufficient explanation
of the features just referred to.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have, however, already suggested other questions about
the reality of those possible essences. Is their possibility, so far
as known to us, explained by our experience of actual things?
Or must we think them as eternally, necessarily and immutably
possible? From the manner in which we must apprehend them,
can we infer anything about the reality of an Eternal, Immutable,
Necessary Intelligence, in whose Thought and Essence
alone those essences, as apprehended by our minds, can find
their ultimate ground and explanation? These are the questions
we must now endeavour to examine.

16. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Possible Essences as such are Something Distinct
from mere Logical Being, and from Nothingness.</span></span>—There
have been philosophers who have held that the actual
alone is real, and only while it is actual; that a purely (intrinsically)
possible essence as such is nothing real; that the actual
alone is possible; that the purely possible as such is impossible.
This view is based on the erroneous assumption that whatever
is or becomes actual is so, or becomes so, by some sort of unintelligible
fatalistic necessity. Apart from the fact that it is
incompatible with certain truths of theism, such as the Divine
Omnipotence and Freedom in creating, it also involves the
denial of all real becoming or change, and the assertion that all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
actuality is eternal; for if anything becomes actual, it was previously
either possible or impossible; if impossible, it could never
become actual; if possible, then as possible it was something
different from the impossible, or from absolute nothingness.
Moreover, the intrinsically possible is capable of becoming actual,
and may be actualized if there exists some actual being with power
to actualize it; but absolute nothingness—or, in other words, the
intrinsically impossible—cannot be actualized, even by Omnipotence;
therefore the possible essence as such is something
positive or real, as distinct from nothingness. Finally, intrinsically
possible essences can be clearly distinguished from one
another by the mind; but their negation which is pure non-entity
or nothingness cannot be so distinguished. It is therefore
clear that possible essences are in some true sense something
positive or real. From which it follows that nothingness, in the
strict sense, is not the mere absence or negation of actuality, but
also the absence or negation of that positive or real something
which is intrinsic possibility; in other words that nothingness in
the strict sense means intrinsic impossibility.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Even those who hold the opinion just rejected—that the
purely possible essence as such has no reality in any conceivable
sense—would presumably admit that it is an object of human
thought at all events; they would accord to it the being it has
from the human mind which thinks it. It would therefore be an
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span> according to this view, having only the ideal being
which consists in its being constituted and contemplated by the
human mind. That it has the ideal being, the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse ideale</span></span> or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse intentionale</span></span>,
which consists in its being contemplated by the human
mind as an object of thought, no one will deny. But a little
reflection will show, firstly, that this ideal being is something
more than the ideal being of an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span>, of a mere logical
entity; and, secondly, that a possible essence must have some
other ideal being than that which it has in the individual human
mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The possible essence is not a mere logical entity; for the
latter cannot be conceived as capable of existing apart from the
human mind, in the world of actual existences (3), whereas the
former can be, and is in fact, conceived as capable of such
existence. Its ideal being in the human mind is, therefore,
something other than that of a mere logical entity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ideal being which it has in the human mind as an object
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of thought is undoubtedly derived from the mind's knowledge
of actual things. We think of the essences of actually experienced
realities apart from their actual existence. Thus abstracted, we
analyse them, compare them, reason from them. By these processes
we can not merely attain to a knowledge of the actual
existence of other realities above and beyond and outside of our
own direct and immediate intuitional experience, but we can
also form concepts of multitudes of realities or essences as intrinsically
possible, thus giving these latter an ideal existence in our
own minds. Here, then, the question arises: Is this the only
ideal being that can be ascribed to such essences? In other
words, are essences intrinsically possible because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we think</span></em> them
as intrinsically possible? Or is it not rather the case that we
think them to be intrinsically possible because they are intrinsically
possible? Does our thought constitute, or does it not
rather merely discover, their intrinsic possibility? Does the
latter result from, or is it not rather presupposed by, our thought-activity?
The second alternative suggested in each of these
questions is the true one. As our thought is not the source of
their actuality, neither is it the source of their intrinsic possibility.
Solipsism is the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">reductio ad absurdum</span></span> of the philosophy which
would reduce all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actuality</span></em> experienced by the individual mind to
phases, or phenomena, or self-manifestations, of the individual
mind itself as the one and only actuality. And no less absurd
is the philosophy which would accord to all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsically possible</span></em>
realities no being other than the ideal being which they have as
the thought-objects of the individual human mind. The study
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> world of direct experience leads the impartial and
sincere inquirer to the conclusion that it is in some true sense a
manifestation of mind or intelligence: not, however, of his own
mind, which is itself only a very tiny item in the totality of the
actual world, but of one Supreme Intelligence. And in this same
Intelligence the world of possible essences too will be found to
have its original and fundamental ideal being.

Some few medieval scholastics<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> contended that possible
essences have from all eternity not indeed the existence they
may receive by creation or production in time, but an intrinsic
essential being which, by creation or production, may be transferred
to the order of actual existences, and which, when actual
existence ceases (if they ever receive it), still continues immutable
and incorruptible: what these writers called the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse
essentiae</span></span>, as distinct from the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse existentiae</span></span>, conceiving it to be
intermediate between the latter on the one hand and mere ideal
or logical being on the other, and hence calling it <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse diminutum</span></span>
or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">secundum quid</span></span>. Examining the question from the standpoint
of theism, these authors seem to have thought that since God
understands these essences as possible from all eternity, and
since this knowledge must have as its term or object something
real and positive, these essences must have some real and
proper intrinsic being from all eternity: otherwise they would
be simply nothingness, and nothingness cannot be the term of
the Divine Intelligence. But the obvious reply is that though
possible essences as such are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing actual</span></em> they must be distinguished
as realities, capable of actually existing, from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute
nothingness</span></em>; and that as thus distinguished from absolute nothingness
they are really and positively intelligible to the Divine Mind,
as indeed they are even to the human mind. To be intelligible
they need not have actual being. They must, no doubt, be
capable of having actual being, in order to be understood as
realities: it is precisely in this understood capability that their
reality consists, for the real includes not only what actually
exists but whatever is capable of actual existence. Whatever is
opposed to absolute nothingness is real; and this manifestly includes
not only the actual but whatever is intrinsically possible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Realities or essences which have not actual being have only
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ideal being; and ideal being means simply presence in some
mind as an object of thought. Scholastic philosophers generally<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>
hold that possible essences as such have no other being than this;
that before and until such essences actually exist they have of
themselves and in themselves no being except the ideal being
which they have as objects of the Divine Intelligence and the
virtual being they have in the Divine Omnipotence which may
at any time give them actual existence. One convincing reason
for this view is the consideration that if possible essences as such
had from all eternity any proper and intrinsic being in themselves,
God could neither create nor annihilate. For in that hypothesis
essences, on becoming actual, would not be produced <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex nihilo</span></span>,
inasmuch as before becoming actual they would in themselves
and from all eternity have had their own proper real being; and
after ceasing to be actual they would still retain this. But creation
is the production of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the whole reality</span></em> of actual being from
nothingness; and is therefore impossible if the actual being is
merely produced from an essence already real, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> having an
eternal positive reality of its own. The same is true of annihilation.
The theory of eternally existing uncreated <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matter</span></em> is no
less incompatible with the doctrine of creation than this theory
of eternally real and uncreated forms or essences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, what could this supposed positive and proper reality
of the possible essence be? If it is anything distinct from the
mere ideal being of such an essence, as it is assumed to be, it
must after all be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> being of some sort, which would apparently
have to be actualized again in order to have actual
existence! Finally, this supposed eternal reality, proper to
possible essences, cannot be anything uncreated. For whatever
is uncreated is God; and since it is these supposed proper
realities of possible essences that are made actual, and constitute
the existing created universe, the latter would be in this view an
actualization of the Divine Essence itself,—which is pantheism
pure and simple. And neither can this supposed eternal reality,
proper to possible essences, be anything created. For such creation
would be eternal and necessary; whereas God's creative
activity is admitted by all scholastics to be essentially free; and
although they are not agreed as to whether <span class="tei tei-q">“creation from all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

it is not a fact.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Possible essences as such are therefore nothing actual.
Furthermore, as such they have in themselves no positive being.
But they are not therefore unreal. They are positively intelligible
as capable of actual existence, and therefore as distinct from
logical entities or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span> which are not capable of such
existence. They are present as objects of thought to mind; and
to some mind other than the individual human mind. About
this ideal being which they have in this Mind we have now in
the next place to inquire.

this necessity of relations, hypothetical as it is and contingent on the mental
processes of analysis and comparison, involved as it is in the very nature of
being and thought, and expressed as it is in the principles of identity and
contradiction, is just as true of actual contingent essences as of possible

abstraction the mind would have before it only what Balmes describes
as </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">the abyss of nothing</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. And Balmes is right in saying that the

is not, as Balmes contends, because when it has removed actual things and
finite minds there still remains in spite of it a system or order of possible
essences which forces it to infer and posit the existence of an Eternal, Necessary
Mind as the source and ground of that order. The reason rather is because
the mind sees that the known </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actual</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> things, from which it got all its notions
of possible essences, necessarily imply, as the only intelligible ground of their
actuality, the existence of a Necessary Being, in whose Intelligence they
must have been contained ideally, and in whose Omnipotence they must have
been contained virtually, from all eternity. From contingent </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actuality</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, as
known to it, the mind can argue to the eternal actuality of Necessary Being,
and to the impossibility either of a state of absolute nothingness, or of an
order of purely possible things apart from all actuality.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(3) Of course, whether the mind has thus thought out the ultimate implications
of the actuality of experienced things or not, once it has thought
and experienced those things it cannot by any effort banish the memory of
them from its presence: they are there still as objects of its thought even
when it abstracts from their actual existence. But if, while it has not yet
seen that their actuality implies the existence of a Necessary, Omniscient and
Omnipotent Being, it abstracts not only from their actual existence but from
the existence of all finite minds (itself included), then in that state, so far as its
knowledge goes, there would be neither actual nor ideal nor possible being.
Nor can the fact that an ideal order of possible things still persists in its own
thought mislead it into concluding that such an ideal order really persists in the
hypothesis it has made. For it knows that this ideal order still persists for itself
simply because it cannot </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">think itself away</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. It sees all the time that if it
could effectively think itself away, this ideal order would have to disappear with
it, leaving nothing—so far as it knows—either actual or possible. Mercier has
some apposite remarks on this very point. </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">From the fact,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> he writes, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">that
those abstract essences, grasped by our abstractive thought from the dawn of
our reason, have grown so familiar to us, we easily come to look upon them
as pre-existing archetypes or models of our thoughts and of things; they form
a fund of predicates by which we are in the habit of interpreting the data of
our experience. So, too, the hypothetically necessary relations established by
abstract thought between them we come to regard as a sort of eternal system
of principles, endowed with a sort of legislative power, to which created things
and intelligences must conform. But they have really no such pre-existence.
The eternal pre-existence of those essence-types, which Plato called the

power of their relations, are a sort of mental optical illusion. Those abstract
essences, and the principles based upon them, are the products of our mental
activity working on the data of our actual experience. When we enter on
the domain of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">speculative reflection</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> ... they are there before us; ... but
we must not forget that reflection is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">consequent</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> on the spontaneous thought-activity
which—by working abstractively on the actual data of sensible, contingent,

from psychology how those ideal, abstract essence-types are formed.... But
because we have no actual memory of their formation, which is so rapid as
practically to escape consciousness in spontaneous thought, we are naturally
prone to imagine that they are not the product of our own mental action on
the data of actual experience, but that they exist in us, or rather above us,
and independently of us. We can therefore understand the psychological
illusion under which Plato wrote such passages as the following: </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">But if
anyone should tell me why anything is beautiful, either because it has a blooming,

confine myself to this, that nothing else causes it to be beautiful, except either
the presence or communication of that abstract beauty, by whatever means
and in whatever way communicated; for I cannot yet affirm with certainty,
but only that by means of beauty all beautiful things become beautiful (τῷ

But this Platonic doctrine, attributing to the abstract essences conceived
by our thought a reality independent both of our thought and of the actual
sense data from which directly or indirectly we derive our concepts of them,
is rejected as unsound by scholastics generally. When we have proved from
actual things that God exists, and is the Intelligent and Free Creator of the
actual world of our direct experience, we can of course consider the Divine
Intellect as contemplating from all eternity the Divine Essence, and as seeing
therein the eternal archetypes or ideas of all actual and possible essences. We
may thus regard the Divine Mind as the eternal τόπος νοητός, or </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">mundus intelligibilis</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.
This, of course, is not Plato's thought; it is what St. Augustine
substituted for Platonism, and very properly. But we must not infer, from
this truth, that when we contemplate possible essences, with all the characteristics
we may detect in them, we are contemplating this </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">mundus intelligibilis</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">
which is the Divine Mind. This was the error of the ontologists. They inferred
that since possible essences, as known by the human mind, have ideal
being independently of the latter and of all actual contingent reality, the human
mind in contemplating them has really an intuition of them as they are seen
by the Divine Intellect Itself in the Divine Essence; so that, in the words of
Gioberti, the </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Primum Ontologicum</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, the Divine Being Himself, is also the

Now those authors who hold that the ideal order of possible essences
contemplated by the human mind is seen by the latter, as so contemplated,
to have some being, some ideal being, really independent of the human mind
itself, and of the actual contingent things from which they admit that the
human mind derives its knowledge of such essences,—these authors </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">do not

The considerations urged in the foregoing paragraphs will, however, have
shown that the validity of this line of reasoning from possible essences to the
reality of an Eternal, Divine, Immutable Intelligence is by no means evident
or free from difficulties. Of course, when the existence of God has been
proved from actual things, the conception of the Divine Intelligence and
Essence as the ultimate source of all possible reality, no less than of all actual
reality, will be found to shed a great deal of new light upon the intrinsic possibility
of possible essences. Since, however, our knowledge of the Divine is
merely analogical, and since God's intuition of possible essences, as imitations
of His own Divine Essence, completely transcends our comprehension, and is
totally different from our abstractive knowledge of such essences, our conception
of the manner in which these essences are related to the Divine Nature
and the Divine Attributes, must be determined after the analogy of the manner
in which our own minds are related to these essences.

of this to the intrinsically possible, and of this again to the essential
type which is presupposed by our thought. Therefore, </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">a pari</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, we must consider
the omnipotent will of God, which is the first and universal cause of all

this in turn as having for its object the Divine Essence and in it the essential

the Divine Being.</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Philosophers who deny the validity of all the arguments
advanced by theists in proof of the existence of a transcendent
Supreme Being, distinct from the world of direct human experience,
endeavour to account in various ways for the intrinsic
possibility of abstract essences. Agnostics either deny to these
latter any reality whatsoever (<a href="#Section_16" class="tei tei-ref">16</a>), or else declare the problem of
their reality insoluble. Monists of the materialist type—who try
to reduce all mind to matter and its mere mechanical energies
(<a href="#Section_11" class="tei tei-ref">11</a>)—treat the question in a still more inadequate and unsatisfactory
manner; while the advocates of idealistic monism, like
Hegel and his followers, refer us to the supposed Immanent Mind
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the universe for an ultimate explanation of all intrinsic possibility.
Certainly this must have its ultimate source in some mind;
and it is not in referring us to an Eternal Mind that these philosophers
err, but in their conception of the relation of this mind to
the world of direct actual experience. It is not, however, with such
theories we are concerned just now, but only with theories put forward
by theists. And among these latter it is surprising to find
some few<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a> who maintain that the intrinsic possibility of abstract
essences depends ultimately and exclusively on these essences
themselves, irrespective of things actually experienced by the
human mind, irrespective of the human mind itself, and irrespective
of the Divine Mind and the Divine Nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to this view, we have already seen (<a href="#Section_19" class="tei tei-ref">19</a>) that if we abstract
from all human minds, and from all actual things that can be
directly experienced by such minds, we are face to face either
with the alternative of absolute nothingness wherein the true and
the false, the possible and the impossible, cease to have any
intelligible meaning, or else with the alternative of a Supreme,
Eternal, Necessary, Omniscient and Omnipotent Being, whose
actual existence has been, or can be, inferred from the actual
data of human experience. Now the theist, who admits the
existence of such a Being, cannot fail to see that possible essences
must have their primary ideal being in the Divine Intellect, and
the ultimate source of their intrinsic possibility in the Divine
Essence Itself. For, knowing that God can actualize intrinsically
possible essences by the creative act, which is intelligent and free,
he will understand that these essences have their ideal being in
the Divine Intellect; that the Divine Intellect sees their intrinsic
possibility by contemplating the Divine Essence as the Uncreated
Prototype and Exemplar of all intrinsically possible
things; and that these latter are intrinsically possible precisely
because they are possible adumbrations or imitations of the
Divine Nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) But are we to conceive that essences are intrinsically
possible precisely because the Divine Intellect, by understanding
them, makes them intrinsically possible? Or should we rather
conceive their intrinsic possibility as antecedent to this act by
which the Divine Intellect understands them, and as dependent
only on the Divine Essence Itself, so that essences would be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
intrinsically possible simply because the Divine Essence is what
it is, and because they are possible imitations or expressions of it?
Here scholastics are not agreed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a> hold that the intrinsic possibility of essences is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em>
constituted by the act whereby the Divine Intellect, contemplating
the Divine Essence, understands the latter to be indefinitely
imitable <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad extra</span></span>; so that as the actuality of things results from
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Fiat</span></span> of the Divine Will, and as their extrinsic possibility is
grounded in the Divine Omnipotence, so their intrinsic possibility
is grounded in the Divine Intellect. The latter, by understanding
the Divine Essence, would not merely give an ideal being to the
intrinsic possibility of essences, but would make those essences
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em> possible, they being only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">virtually</span></em> possible in the Divine
Essence considered antecedently to this act of the Divine Intellect.
Or, rather, as some Scotists explain the matter,<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a> this ideal
being which possible essences have from the Divine Intellect is
not as extrinsic to them as the ideal being they have from the
human intellect, but is rather the very first being they can be
said <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em> to have, and is somehow intrinsic to them after the
analogy of the being which mere logical entities, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span>,
derive from the human mind: which being is intrinsic to these
entities and is in fact the only being they have or can have.

Others<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> hold that while, no doubt, possible essences have
ideal being in the Divine Intellect from the fact that they are
objects of the Divine Knowledge, yet we must not conceive these
essences as deriving their intrinsic possibility from the Divine
Intellect. For intellect as such presupposes its object. Just,
therefore, as possible essences are not intrinsically possible
because they are understood by, and have ideal being in, the
human mind, so neither are they intrinsically possible because
they are understood by, and have ideal being in, the Divine
Mind. In order to be understood actually, in order to have
ideal being, in order to be objects of thought, they must be
intelligible; and in order to be intelligible they must be
intrinsically possible. Therefore they are formally constituted
as intrinsically possible essences, not by the fact that they are
understood by the Divine Intellect, but by the fact that antecedently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to this act (in our way of conceiving the matter: for
there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> no priority of acts or attributes in God) they are
already possible imitations of the Divine Essence Itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This view seems preferable as being more in accordance with
the analogy of what takes place in the human mind. The
speculative intellect in man does not constitute, but presupposes
its object. Now, while <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> things are the objects of God's
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical science</span></em>—the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia visionis</span></span>,”</span> which reaches what is
freely decreed by the Divine Will,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possible</span></em> things are the objects
of God's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">speculative</span></em> science—the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia simplicis intelligentiae</span></span>,”</span>
which is not, like the former, productive of its object, but rather
contemplative of objects presented to it by and in the Divine
Essence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Why, then, ultimately will the notions <span class="tei tei-q">“square”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“circle”</span>
not coalesce so as to form one object of thought for the human
mind, while the notions <span class="tei tei-q">“equilateral”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“triangle”</span> will so
coalesce? Because the Essence of God, the Necessary Being,
the First Reality, and the Source of all contingent reality, affords
no basis for the former as a possible expression or imitation of
Itself; in other words, because Being is not expressible by
nothingness, and a <span class="tei tei-q">“square circle”</span> is nothingness: while the
Divine Essence does afford a basis for the latter; because
Necessary Being is in some intelligible way imitated, expressed,
manifested, by whatever has any being to distinguish it from
nothingness, and an <span class="tei tei-q">“equilateral triangle”</span> has such being and is
not nothingness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is hardly necessary to add that when we conceive the
Divine Essence, contemplated by the Divine Intellect, as containing
in itself the exemplars or prototypes of all possible things,
we are not to understand the Divine Essence as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em>
exemplar of each, or, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a fortiori</span></span>, as a vast collection of such formally

21. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Distinction Between Essence and Existence in
Actually Existing Contingent or Created Beings.</span></span>—Passing
now from the consideration of possible essences as such,
to the consideration of actually existing essences, we have to
examine a question which has given rise to a great deal of
controversy, partly on account of its inherent difficulty, and
partly because of a multitude of ambiguities arising from confusion
of thought: What is the nature of the distinction between
essence and existence in the actually existing things of our
experience?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have seen already that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concepts</span></em> of essence and existence
are distinct from each other (<a href="#Section_12" class="tei tei-ref">12</a>, <a href="#Section_13" class="tei tei-ref">13</a>); in other words,
that in all cases there is at least a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical</span></em> distinction between the
essence and the existence of any being. We must, however,
distinguish between created or contingent beings and the
Uncreated, Necessary, Self-Existent Being. The latter exists
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essentially</span></em>, eternally, by His own Essence, so that in Him
essence and existence are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really identical</span></em>. His essence is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em>
His Existence; and, therefore, in thinking of His Essence we
cannot positively exclude the notion of existence or think of
Him as non-existent. The distinction between essence and
existence, which we find in our thoughts, is, therefore, when
applied to God, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purely logical</span></em> distinction, due solely to our
finite human mode of thinking, and having no ground or basis or
reason in the reality which is the object of our thought. On
this there is complete unanimity among scholastic philosophers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But while we conceive that God actually exists by that
whereby He is God, by His Essence Itself, we do not conceive
that any created or contingent being exists by that whereby it
is what it is, by its essence. We do not, for example, regard
the essence of Socrates, whether specific or individual (that
whereby he is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></em>, or that whereby he is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> man, Socrates),
as that whereby he actually exists. In other words, the essence
of the existing Socrates, being a contingent essence, does not
necessarily demand or imply that it actually exist. Our concept
of such an essence does not include the note of actual existence.
Therefore if we find such an essence actually existing we consider
this actually existing essence as caused or produced, and
conserved in existence, by some other being, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> by the
Necessary Being: so that if it were not so created and conserved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it would be a pure possibility and nothing actual.<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> The
same difference between the Necessary Being and contingent
beings will be seen from considering their existence. The
abstract concept of existence is rendered definite and determinate
by the essence which it actualizes. Now every finite essence is
of some particular kind; and its existence is rendered determinate
by the fact that it is the existence of a definite kind of
essence. The existence of a contingent being we conceive as
the actuality of its essence; and its essence as a definite potentiality
of existence. Thus if we conceive existence as a perfection
it is restricted by the finite nature of the potentiality which
it actualizes. But the existence of the Necessary Being is the
plenitude of actuality, an existence not restricted by being the
existence of any essence that is determinate because finite, but
of an essence that is determinate by being above all genera and
species, by being infinite, by being Itself pure actuality, in no
sense potential but perfectly and formally identical with actual
existence. While, therefore, the essence of the Necessary Being
is a necessarily existing essence, that of a contingent being is
not necessarily existent, but is conceived as a potentiality which
has been <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> actualized or made existent by the Necessary
Being, and which may again cease to be actually existent.<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> On
this too there is unanimity among scholastic philosophers.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We distinguish mentally or logically between the essence of
an actually existing contingent being and its existence; considering
the former as the potential principle, in relation to the latter
as the actualizing principle, of the contingent existing reality.
But is the distinction between such an essence and its existence
something more than a logical distinction? Is it a real distinction?
This is the question in dispute. And in order to avoid misunderstanding,
we must be clear on these two points: firstly,
of what essence and existence is there question? and secondly,
what exactly are we to understand by a real distinction in this
matter?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
22. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">State of the Question.</span></span>—In the first place, there is no
question here of the relation of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possible</span></em> essence as such to existence.
The possible essence of a contingent being, as such, has
no reality outside the Divine Essence, Intellect, Will, and Omnipotence.
Before the world was created the possible essences of
all the beings that constitute it were certainly really distinct from
the actual existence of these beings which do constitute the
created universe. On this point there can be no difference of
opinion. To contend that it is on the eternal reality of the possible
essence that actual existence supervenes, when a contingent
being begins to exist, would be equivalent to contending that it
is the Divine Essence that becomes actual in the phenomena of
our experience: which is the error of Pantheism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, before a contingent thing comes into actual existence
it may be virtually and potentially in the active powers and
passive potentialities of other actually existing contingent things:
as the oak, for instance, is in the passive potentiality of the acorn
and in the active powers of the natural agencies whereby it is
evolved from the acorn; or the statue in the block of marble
and in the mind and artistic power of the sculptor. But neither
is there any question here of the relation of such potential being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or essence as a thing has in its causes to the actual existence of
this thing when actually produced. Whatever being or essence
it has in its active and passive causes is certainly really distinct
from the existence which the thing has when it has been actually
produced. Nor is there any doubt or dispute about this point.
At the same time much controversy is due to misunderstandings
arising from a confusion of thought which fails to distinguish
between the essence as purely possible, the essence as virtually
or potentially in its causes, and the essence as actually existing.
It is about the distinction between the latter and its existence
that the whole question is raised. And it must be borne in mind
that this essence, whether it is really distinct from its existence
or not, is itself a positive reality from the moment it is created
or produced. The question is whether the creative or productive
act—whereby this essence is placed <span class="tei tei-q">“outside its causes,”</span> and is
now no longer merely possible, or merely virtual or potential in
its causes, but something real <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in itself</span></em>—has for its term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one reality</span></em>,
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two realities</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the essence as real subjective potentiality of
existence, and the existential act or perfection whereby it is constituted
actually existent.<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question is exclusively concerned with the essence which
began to exist when the contingent being came into actual existence,
and which ceases to exist when, or if, this being again
passes out of actual existence; and the question is whether this
essence which actually exists is really distinct from the existence
whereby it actually exists. Finally, the question concerns the
essence and existence of any and every actual contingent reality,
whether such reality be a substance or an accident. Of course
it is primarily concerned with the essence and existence of substances;
but it also applies to the essence and existence of
accidents in so far as these latter will be found to be really distinct
from the substances in which they inhere, and to have reality
proper to themselves.

thought in regard to the theory of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinctions</span></em>, and in regard to
the application of the theory to the present question, has been
probably the most fertile source of much tedious and fruitless
controversy in this connexion.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Anticipating what will be considered more fully at a later
stage (<a href="#Section_30" class="tei tei-ref">30</a>), we must note here the two main classes of distinction
which, by reflecting on our thought-processes, we discover
between the objects of our thought. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> distinction is that
which exists in things independently of the consideration of our
minds; that which is discovered, but not made, by the mind;
that which is given to us in and with the data of our experience.
For example, the act of thinking is a reality other than, and
therefore <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> distinct from, the mind that thinks; for the
mind persists after the act of thinking has passed away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Opposed to this is the mental or logical distinction, which
is the distinction made by the mind itself between two different
concepts of one and the same reality; which is not in the reality
independently of our thought, but is introduced into it by our
thought, regarding the same reality under different aspects or
from different points of view. The mind never makes such a
distinction without some ground or reason for doing so.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sometimes, however, this reason will be found exclusively in
the mind itself—in the limitations of its modes of thought—and
not in the reality which is the matter or object of the thought.
The distinction is then said to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purely</span></em> logical or mental. Such
distinctions are <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span>, logical entities. An example would
be the distinction between the concept <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span> and the concept
<span class="tei tei-q">“rational animal,”</span> or, in general, between any definable object
of thought and its definition; the distinction, therefore, between
the essence and the existence of the Necessary Being is a purely
logical distinction, for in a definition it is the essence of the thing
we define, and existence is of the essence or definition of the
Necessary Being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sometimes, again, the reason for making a mental distinction
will be found in the reality itself. What is one and the same
reality presents different aspects to the mind and evokes different
concepts of itself in the mind: though really one, it is virtually
manifold; and the distinction between the concepts of these
various aspects is commonly known as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">virtual</span></em> distinction.
For example, when we think of any individual man as a
<span class="tei tei-q">“rational animal,”</span> though our concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“animal nature”</span> is
distinct from that of <span class="tei tei-q">“rational nature,”</span> we do not regard these in
him as two realities co-existing or combining to form his human
nature, but only as two distinct aspects under which we view the
one reality which is his human nature. And we view it under
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these two aspects because we have actual experience of instances
in which animal nature is really distinct and separated from
rationality, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, in the brute beast. Or, again, since we can recognize
three grades of life in man—vegetative, sentient, and
rational—we conceive the one principle of life, his soul, as virtually
three principles; and so we distinguish mentally or virtually
between three souls in man, although in reality there is only one.
Or, once more, when we think of the Wisdom, the Will, and the
Omnipotence of God, we know that although these concepts
represent different aspects of the Deity, these aspects are not
distinct realities in Him; but that because of His infinite perfection
and infinite simplicity they are all objectively one and the
same self-identical reality.

A virtual distinction is said to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imperfect</span></em> (thus approaching
nearer to the nature of a purely logical distinction) when each of
the concepts whereby we apprehend the same reality only prescinds
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">explicitly</span></em> from what is expressed by the other, although
one of them is found on analysis to include <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">implicitly</span></em> what is
expressed by the other. Such is the distinction between the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">life</span></em> of any living thing; or the distinction between

between the divine attributes in general. A virtual distinction
is said to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect</span></em> (thus approaching nearer to the
nature of a real distinction) when neither of the concepts
includes either explicitly or implicitly what is expressed by the
other. Such, for instance, is the distinction between the principle
of intellectual life and the principle of animal or sentient life in
man; for not only can these exist separately (the former without
the latter, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> in pure spirits, the latter without the former,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> in brute beasts), but also it will be found that by no analysis
does either concept in any way involve the other.<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a>

Our only object in setting down the various examples just
given is to illustrate the general scholastic teaching on the
doctrine of distinction. In themselves they are not beyond
dispute, for the general doctrine of distinction is not easy of
application in detail; but they will be sufficient for our present
purpose. Probably the greatest difficulty in applying the general
doctrine will be found to lie in discriminating between virtual
distinctions—especially perfect virtual distinctions—and real
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

we learn that a real distinction does not necessarily involve
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">separability</span></em> of the objects so distinguished. In other words there
may be, in a composite existing individual being, constitutive
factors or principles, or integral parts, each of which is a positive
real entity, really distinct from the others, and yet incapable of
existing separately or in isolation from the others. <span class="tei tei-q">“Separability,”</span>
says Mercier,<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“is one of the signs of a real distinction;
but it is neither essential to, nor a necessary property of the latter.
Two separable things are of course really distinct from each
other; but two entities may be really distinct from each other
without being separable or capable of existing apart from each
other. Thus we believe that the intellect and the will in man
are really distinct from each other, and both alike from the substance
of the human soul; yet they cannot exist isolated from
the soul.”</span> Therefore, even though the objects which we apprehend
as distinct, by means of distinct concepts, be understood to
be such that they cannot actually exist in isolation from each
other, but only as united in a composite individual being, still if
it can be shown that each of them has its own proper reality independently
of our thought, so that the distinction between them
is not the result of our thought, or introduced by our thought
into the individual thing or being which we are considering, then
the distinction must be regarded as real. If, on the other hand,
it can be shown that the different aspects which we apprehend in
any <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">datum</span></span> by means of distinct concepts have not, apart from
the consideration of the mind, apart from the analytic activity
of our own thought, each its own proper reality, but are only
distinct mental views of what is objectively one and the same
reality, then the distinction must be regarded as logical, not real,—and
this even although there may be in the richness and fulness
of that one reality comparatively to the limited capacity of our
minds, as well as in the very constitution and modes of thought
of our minds themselves, a reason or basis for, and an explanation
of, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">multiplicity of concepts</span></em> whereby we attain to an understanding

consideration of the serious problems on the validity of knowledge
and its relation to reality, to which those reflections
inevitably give rise, let us now return to the main question:
the nature of the distinction between the essence and the existence
of any actually existing contingent being. We need not
be surprised to find that the greatest minds have been unable to
reach the same solution of this question. For it is but a phase
of the more general metaphysical problem—at once both
ontological and epistemological—of the nature of reality and the
relation of the human mind thereto. Nor will any serious
modern philosopher who is at all mindful of the wealth of
current controversial literature on this very problem, or of the
endless variety of conflicting opinions among contemporary
thinkers in regard to it, be disposed to ridicule the medieval
controversies on the doctrine of distinction as applied to essence
and existence. No doubt there has been a good deal of mere
verbal, and perhaps trifling, argumentation on the matter: it
lends itself to the dialectical skill of the controversialist who
<span class="tei tei-q">“takes sides,”</span> as well as to the serious thought of the open-minded
investigator. It is not, however, through drawing
different conclusions from the same premisses that conflicting
solutions of the question have been reached, but rather through
fundamentally different attitudes in regard to the premisses
themselves which different philosophers profess to find in the
common data of their experience. When we have once grasped
what philosophers mean by a logical or a real distinction as
applied to the relation between essence and existence we shall
not get any very material assistance towards the choice of a solution
by considering at length the arguments adduced on either
side.<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a>

nevertheless distinct realities—distinct in the objective order and

We might attempt to illustrate this by the analogy of a body and its
shape or colour. The body itself is really distinct from its actual shape and
colour: it may lose them, and yet remain the same body; and it may
acquire other shapes and colours. At any time the body has actually some
particular shape and colour; but that by which it is formally so shaped and
coloured is something really different from the body itself. Furthermore,
before the body </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actually</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> possessed this particular shape and colour, these
were in it </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">potentially</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">: that is to say, there were then in the body the real,

This view, thus advocating a real distinction between essence
and existence, may obviously be regarded as an emphatic expression
of the objective validity of intellectual knowledge. It
might be regarded as an application of the more general view
that the objective concepts between which the intellect distinguishes
in its interpretation of reality should be regarded as representing
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinct realities</span></em>, except when the distinction is seen
to arise not from the nature of the object but from the nature of the
subject, from the limitations and imperfections of our own modes
of thought. But in the case of any particular (disputed) distinction,
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">onus probandi</span></span> should lie rather on the side of those who contend
that such distinction is logical, and not real. On the other hand,
many philosophers who are no less firmly convinced of the objective
validity of intellectual knowledge observe that it is possible to push
this principle too far, or rather to err by excess in its application.
Instead of placing the burden of proof solely on the side of the
logical distinction, they would place it rather more on the side
of the real distinction—in conformity with the maxim of method,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem</span></span>. And they
think that it is an error by excess to hold the distinction between
essence and existence to be real. This brings us to the second
alternative opinion: that the distinction in question is not real,
but only virtual.<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a>

According to this view, the essence and the existence of any
existing contingent being are one and the same reality. There
is, however, in this reality a basis for the two distinct objective
concepts—of essence and of existence—whereby we apprehend it.
For the contingent being does not exist necessarily: we see such
beings coming into existence and ceasing to exist: we can therefore
think of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what they are</span></em> without thinking of them as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually
existent</span></em>: in other words, we can think of them as possible, and
of their existence as that by which they become actual. This
is a sufficient reason for distinguishing mentally, in the existing
being, the essence which exists and the existence by which it exists.<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a>
But when we think of the essence of an actually existing
being as objectively possible, or as potential in its causes, we are
no longer thinking of it as anything real in itself, but only of its
ideal being as an object of thought in our minds, or of the ideal
being it has in the Divine Mind, or of the potential being it
has in created causes, or of the virtual being it has in the Divine
Omnipotence, or of the ultimate basis of its possibility in the
Divine Essence. But all these modes of <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> we know to
be really distinct from the real, contingent essence itself which
begins to exist actually in time, and may cease once more to
exist in time when and if its own nature demands, and God
wills, such cessation. But that the real, contingent essence itself
which so exists, is something really distinct from the existence
whereby it exists; that it forms with the latter a really composite
being; that it is in itself a real, subjective potentiality,
receptive of existence as another and actualizing reality, really
distinct from it, so that the creation or production of any single
actually existing contingent being would have for its term two
really distinct principles of being, a potential and an actual,
essence and existence, created or produced <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per modum unius</span></span>, so
to speak: for asserting all this it is contended by supporters of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the virtual distinction that we have no sufficient justifying reason.<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a>

Though each of these opinions has been defended with a great deal of
ability, and an exhaustive array of arguments, a mere rehearsal of these latter
would not give much material assistance towards a solution of the question.
We therefore abstain from repeating them here. There are only a few points
in connexion with them to which attention may be directed.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
In the first place, some defenders of the real distinction urge that were
the distinction not real, things would exist essentially, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> necessarily; and thus
the most fundamental ground of distinction between God and creatures, between
the Necessary Being and contingent beings, would be destroyed:
creatures would be no longer in their very constitution composite, mixtures of
potentiality and actuality, but would be purely actual, absolutely simple and,
in a word, identical with the Infinite Being Himself. Supporters of the
virtual distinction deny that those very serious consequences follow from their
view. They point out that though the existence of the creature is really
identical with its essence, the essence does not exist necessarily or </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">a se</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">; the
whole existing essence is </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">ab alio</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, is caused, contingent; and the fundamental
distinction between such a being and the Self-Existing Being is in
this view perfectly clear. Nor is the creature, they contend, purely actual
and absolutely simple; it need not have existed, and it may cease to exist;
it has, therefore, a potentiality of non-existence, which is inconceivable in the
case of the Necessary and purely Actual Being; it is, therefore, mutable as
regards existence; besides which the essences even of the most simple created
beings, namely pure spirits are composite in the sense that they have
faculties and operations really distinct from their substance.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Secondly, it is alleged by some defenders of the real distinction that this
latter view of the nature of existing contingent reality is a cardinal doctrine
in the whole philosophical system of St. Thomas, and of scholastics generally:
so fundamental, in fact, that many important doctrines, unanimously held to
be true by all scholastics, cannot be successfully vindicated apart from it.</span><a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
To which it is replied that there are no important truths of scholastic philosophy
which cannot be defended quite adequately apart altogether from the
view one may hold on the present question; and that, this being the
case, it is unwise to endeavour to base admittedly true doctrines, which
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">

only the amount of probability it can derive from the intrinsic merits of the
arguments by which it is itself supported.</span><a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Before passing from this whole question we must note the existence of a
third school of thought, identified mainly with the followers of Duns Scotus.</span><a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">

in grasping and setting forth their meaning with any tolerable degree of
clearness, would suggest the reflection that in those controversies the medieval

task which, conceived in these terms, must appear fruitless; and one which,
anyhow, involves in its very nature the closest scrutiny of the epistemological
problem of the power of the human mind to get at least a true and valid, if
not adequate and comprehensive, insight into the nature of reality.

25. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Transcendental Attributes or Properties of
Being: Unity, Truth, and Goodness.</span></span>—So far, we have
analysed the notions of Real Being, of Becoming or Change, of
Being as Possible and as Actual, of Essence and Existence.
Before approaching a study of the Categories or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Suprema Genera
Entis</span></span>, the highest and widest modes in which reality manifests
itself, we have next to consider certain attributes or properties of
being which reveal themselves as co-extensive with reality itself.
Taking human experience in its widest sense, as embracing all
modes that are cognitive or allied with consciousness, as including
intellect, memory, imagination, sense perception, will and
appetite, as speculative, ethical or moral, and esthetic or artistic,—we
find that the reality which makes up this complex human
experience of ours is universally and necessarily characterized by
certain features which we call the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transcendental attributes or
properties of being</span></em>, inasmuch as they transcend all specific and
generic modes of being, pervade all its categories equally, and
are inseparable from any datum of experience. We shall see
that they are not really distinct from the reality which they
characterize, but only logically distinct from it, being aspects
under which we apprehend it, negations or other logical relations
which we necessarily annex to it by the mental processes whereby
we seek to render it actually intelligible to our minds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first in order of these ontological attributes is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unity</span></em>: the
concept of that whereby reality considered in itself becomes a
definite object of thought. The second in order is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em>: which
is the conception of reality considered in its relation to cognitive
experience, to intellect. The third is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">goodness</span></em>: the aspect
under which reality is related as an object to appetitive experience,
to will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now when we predicate of any reality under our consideration
that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“one,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“good,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“true”</span>—in the ontological
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sense to be explained,—that which we predicate is not a mere
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span>, but something real, something which is really
identical with the subject, and which is distinguished from the
latter in our judgment only by a logical distinction. The
attribution of any of these properties to the subject does not,
however, add anything real to the latter: it adds merely some
logical aspect involved in, or supposed by, the attribution. At
the same time, this logical aspect gives us real information by
making explicit some real feature of being not explicitly revealed
in the concept of being itself, although involved in, and following
as a property from, the latter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There do not seem to be any other transcendental properties
of being besides the three enumerated. The terms <span class="tei tei-q">“reality,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“thing,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“something,”</span> are synonymous expressions of the concept
of being itself, rather than of properties of being. <span class="tei tei-q">“Existence”</span>
is not a transcendental attribute of being, for it is not
co-extensive with reality or real being. And although reality
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> be <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">either</span></em> possible <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or</span></em> actual,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">either</span></em> necessary <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or</span></em> contingent,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">either</span></em> infinite <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or</span></em> finite,”</span> etc., this necessity of verifying
in itself one or other member of any such alternatives is not a
property of being, but rather something essentially rooted in the
very concept of reality itself. Some would regard as a distinct
transcendental attribute of being the conception of the latter as
an object of esthetic contemplation, as manifesting order and
harmony, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beautiful</span></em>. This conception of being will be found,
however, to flow from the more fundamental aspects of reality
considered as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em> and as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>, rather than directly from the concept
of being itself.

26. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Transcendental Unity.</span></span>—When we think of anything
as one we think of it as undivided in itself. The unity or oneness
of being is the undividedness of being: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Unum est id quod est
indivisum in se: Universaliter quaecunque non habent divisionem,
inquantum non habent, sic unum dicuntur</span></span>.<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a> When, therefore, we
conceive being as undivided into constitutive parts, and unmultiplied
into repetitions of itself, we conceive it as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> being, as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>. For the concept of being, formally as one, it does not
seem necessary that we conceive being as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divided or distinct from
all other being</span></em>. This second negation, of identity with other
being, rather follows the conception of being as one: being is
distinct from other being because it is already itself one: it is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a prior negation that formally constitutes its unity, namely,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the negation of internal division or multiplication of itself</span></em>: God
was truly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> from all eternity, before there was any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em> being,
any created being, distinct from Him. The division or distinction
of an object of thought from whatever is not itself is what
constitutes the notion of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">otherness</span></em>.<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is manifest that being and unity are really identical, that
when we think of being we think of what is really undivided in
itself, that once we introduce dividedness into the object of our
concept we are no longer thinking of being but of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beings</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of
a multitude or plurality each member of which is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>.
For being, as an object of thought, is either simple or composite.
If simple, it is not only undivided but indivisible. If composite,
we cannot think of it as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> being, capable of existing, so long as
we think its parts as separate or divided: only when we think of
them as actually united and undivided have we the concept of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em>
being: and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">eo ipso</span></span> we have the concept of being as one, as a
unity.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a>

Hence the scholastic formulæ: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ens et unum convertuntur</span></span>,
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Omne ens est unum</span></span>. The truth embodied in these is so self-evident
that the expression of it may seem superfluous; but they
are not mere tautologies, and in the interests of clear and consistent
thinking our attention may be profitably directed to them.
The same remark applies to much in the present and subsequent
chapters on the transcendental attributes of being.

27. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Kinds of Unity.</span></span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The unity we have been describing
has been called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transcendental</span></em>, to distinguish it from
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">predicamental</span></em> unity—the unity which is proper to a special
category of being, namely, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantity</span></em>, and which, accordingly, is
also called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantitative</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mathematical</span></em> unity. While the former
is common to all being, with which it is really identical, and to
which it adds nothing real, the latter belongs and is applicable,
properly speaking, only to the mode of being which is corporeal,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which exists only as affected by quantity, as occupying space, as
capable of measurement; and therefore, also, this latter unity
adds something real to the being which it affects, namely, the attribute
of quantity, of which unity is the measure and the generating
principle.<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a> For quantity, as we shall see, is a mode of being
really distinct from the corporeal substance which it affects. The
quantity has its own transcendental unity; so has the substance
which it quantifies; so has the composite whole, the quantified
body, but this latter transcendental unity, like the composite
being with which it is identical, is not a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">unum per se</span></span> but only a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">unum per accidens</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">infra</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We derive our notion of quantitative or mathematical unity,
which is the principle of counting and the standard of measuring,
from dividing mentally the continuous quantity or magnitude
which is one of the immediate data of sense experience. Now
the distinction between this unit and transcendental unity
supposes not merely that quantity is really distinct from the
corporeal substance, but also that the human mind is capable of
conceiving as real certain modes of being other than the corporeal,
modes to which quantitative concepts and processes,
such as counting and measuring, are not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">properly</span></em> applicable, as
they are to corporeal reality, but only in an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">analogical</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transferred</span></em>
sense (<a href="#Section_2" class="tei tei-ref">2</a>). The notion of transcendental unity, therefore,
bears the same relation to that of quantitative unity, as the notion
of being in general bears to that of quantified or corporeal being.

<a name="Section_27_b" id="Section_27_b" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“unum <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></em>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“unum <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simpliciter</span></em>”</span>), or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em>

characterizes a being which has nothing in it beyond what is
essential to it as such, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the unity of any substance: and this
unity is twofold—(1) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unity of simplicity</span></em> and (2) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unity of composition</span></em>—according
as the substance is essentially simple (such as the
human soul or a pure spirit) or essentially composite (such as man,
or any corporeal substance: since every such substance is composed
essentially of a formative and an indeterminate principle).<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a>

Accidental unity is the unity of a being whose constituent

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Transcendental unity may be either individual (singular,
numerical, concrete, real) or universal (specific, generic, abstract,
logical). The former is that which characterizes being or reality
considered as actually existing or as proximately capable of
existing: the unity of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individual</span></em> nature or essence: the unity
whereby a being is not merely undivided in itself but incapable
of repetition or multiplication of itself. It is only the individual
as such that can actually exist: the abstract and universal is
incapable of actually existing as such. We shall examine presently
what it is that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individuates</span></em> reality, and what it is that
renders it capable of existing actually in the form of <span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span> or
of <span class="tei tei-q">“persons”</span>—the forms in which it actually presents itself in
our experience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Abstract or universal unity is the unity which characterizes
a reality conceived as an abstract, universal object by the human
intellect. The object of a specific or generic concept, <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“animal,”</span> for example, is one in this sense, undivided in itself,
but capable of indefinite multiplication or repetition in the only
mode in which it can actually exist—the individual mode. The
universal is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">unum aptum inesse pluribus</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, we can conceive any nature or essence without considering
it in either of its alternative states—either as individual
or as universal. Thus conceived it is characterized by a unity
which has been commonly designated as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstract</span></em>, or (by Scotists)
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> unity.

the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manifold</span></em>. Units, one of which is not the other, constitute
multitude or plurality. If unity is the negation of actual
division in being, multitude results from a second negation, that,
namely, by which the undivided being or unit is marked off or
divided from other units.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a> We have defined unity by the negation

involves dividedness; but it also involves and presupposes the

can define the former only by exclusion of the latter. The

plurality: a distinction which is to be understood in the

the actually separated or divided condition of quantified being.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Number</span></em> is a multitude measured or counted by unity: it is a

Now it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mathematical</span></em> unity that is, properly, the principle of
number and the standard or measure of all counting; and therefore
it is only to realities which fall within the category of

29. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Individual and the Universal.</span></span>—We have distinguished
transcendental unity into individual and universal
(<a href="#Section_27_c" class="tei tei-ref">27, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span></a>). Reality as endowed with universal unity is reality as
apprehended by abstract thought to be capable of indefinite
repetition or multiplication of itself in actual existence. Reality
as endowed with individual unity is reality apprehended as
actually existing, or as proximately capable of actually existing,
and as therefore incapable of any repetition or multiplication of
itself, of any division of itself into other <span class="tei tei-q">“selves”</span> or communication
of itself to other <span class="tei tei-q">“selves”</span>. While, therefore, the universal
has its reality only in the individuals to which it communicates
itself, and which thus embody it, the individual has its reality in
itself and of its own right, so to speak: when it actually exists
it is <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sui juris</span></span>,”</span> and as such incommunicable, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">incommunicabilis</span></span>”</span>.
The actually existing individual is called in Latin a
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">suppositum</span></span>”</span>—a term which we shall render by the English
<span class="tei tei-q">“thing”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“individual thing”</span>. It was called by Aristotle the
οὐσία πρωτή, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">substantia prima</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“first substance,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“first
essence,”</span> to distinguish it from the substance or essence conceived
by abstract thought as universal; the latter being designated
as οὐσία δέυτερα, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">substantia secunda</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“second substance”</span>
or <span class="tei tei-q">“second essence”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now it is a fundamental assumption in Aristotelian and
scholastic philosophy that whatever actually exists, or whatever
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is real in the sense that as such it is proximately capable of
actual existence, is and must be individual: that the universal as
such is not real, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> as such cannot actually exist. And the
manifest reason for this assumption is that whatever actually
exists must be, with entire definiteness and determinateness, its
own self and nothing else: it cannot be capable of division or
repetition of itself, of that which it really is, into <span class="tei tei-q">“other”</span>
realities which would still be <span class="tei tei-q">“that individual thing”</span>. But
reality considered as universal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> capable of such repetition of
itself indefinitely. Therefore reality cannot actually exist as universal,
but only as individual.

This is merely plain common sense; nor does the idealistic monism
which appears to attribute reality to the universal as such, and which interprets
reality exclusively according to the forms in which it presents itself to
abstract thought, really run counter to this consideration; for what it really
holds is not that universals as such are real, but that they are phases of the
all-one reality which is itself </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">one individual being</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
But many modern philosophers hold that individuality, no less than
universality, is a form of thought. No doubt </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">individuality</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">in the abstract</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
is, no less than universality, an object abstracted from the data of experience
by the mind's analysis of the latter. But this is not what those philosophers
mean. They mean that the individual as such is not a real datum of experience.
From the Kantian view that individuality is a purely mental form
with which the mind invests the datum, they draw the subjectivist conclusion
that the world, thus interpreted as consisting of </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">individuals,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> is a phenomenal
or mental product for the objective validity of which there can be to
man's speculative reason no sufficient guarantee.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
To this theory we oppose that of Aristotle and the scholastics, not merely
that the individual alone is actually existent, but that as actually existent and
as individual it is actually given to us and apprehended by us in internal and
external sense experience; and that although in the inorganic world, and to
some extent in the lower forms of life, we may not be able to determine for
certain what portions of this experience are distinct individuals, still in the
world of living things generally, and especially of the animal kingdom, there
can be no difficulty in determining this, for the simple reason that here reality
is given to us in sense experience as consisting of distinct individuals.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the same time it is true that we can understand these
individual realities, interpret them, read the meaning of them,
only by the intellectual function of judgment, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> by the analytic
and synthetic activity whereby we abstract and universalize
certain aspects of them, and use these aspects as predicates of
the individuals. Now, seeing that intellectual thought, as distinct
from sense experience, apprehends its objects only as
abstract and potentially universal, only as static, self-identical,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
possible essences, and nevertheless predicates these of the concrete,
individual, contingent, actually existing <span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span> of sense
experience, identifying them with the latter in affirmative judgments;
seeing moreover, that—since the intellectual knowledge
we thus acquire about the data of sense experience is genuine
and not chimerical—those <span class="tei tei-q">“objects”</span> of abstract thought must be
likewise real, and must be really in those individual sense data
(according to the theory of knowledge which finds its expression
in Moderate Realism),—there arises immediately the problem, or
rather the group of problems, regarding the relations between
reality as revealed to intellect, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> as abstract and universal, and
reality as revealed to sense, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> as concrete and individual. In
other words, we have to inquire how we are to interpret intellectually
the fact that reality, which as a possible essence is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universal</span></em> for abstract thought, is nevertheless, as actually existing,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individualized</span></em> for sense—and consequently for intellect reflecting
on the data of sense.<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a>

then is the relation between all that intellect

specific nature, and its whole nature as an individual, its <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">essentia
atoma</span></span> or individual nature? We can best approach this problem
by considering first these various abstract thought-objects which
intellect can apprehend in the individual.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What are called the metaphysical grades of being, those
positive moments of perfection or reality which the mind detects
in the individual, as, for instance, substantiality, materiality,
organic life, animality, rationality, individuality, in the individual
man—whether we describe them as <span class="tei tei-q">“phases”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“aspects”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“formalities”</span> of being—are undoubtedly distinct objects for abstract
thought. Why does it thus distinguish between them, and
express them by distinct concepts, even when it finds them
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
embodied in a single individual? Because, reflecting on the
manner in which reality presents itself, through sense experience,
as actually existing, it finds resemblances and differences between
individually distinct data. It finds in some of them grades of
reality which it does not find in others, individual, specific, and
generic grades; and some—transcendental—grades common to
all. Now between these various grades of being as found in one
and the same individual it cannot be denied that there exists a
logical distinction with a foundation or ground for it in the individual
reality; because the latter, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being more or less similar</span></em> to
other individual realities, causes the mind to apprehend it by a
number of distinct concepts: the individuality whereby it differs
really from all other individuals of the same species; the specific,
differential and generic grades of being whereby it is conceptually
identified with wider and wider classes of things; and the transcendental
grades whereby it is conceptually identified with all
others. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">similarity</span></em> of really distinct individuals, which is the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conceptual identity</span></em> of their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">qualities</span></em>, is the ground on which we
conceptually identify their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essences</span></em>. Now is there any reason
for thinking that these grounds of similarity, as found in the individual,
are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really distinct</span></em> from one another in the latter? They
are certainly conceptually distinct expressions—each less inadequate
than the wider ones—of what is really one individual
essence. But we must take them to be all really identical in and
with this individual essence, unless we are prepared to hold conceptual
plurality as such to be real plurality; in which case we
should also hold conceptual unity as such to be real unity. But
this latter view is precisely the error of extreme realism, of reifying
abstract concepts and holding the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">universale a parte rei</span></span>”</span>: a
theory which leads logically to monism.<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a>

these grades of being in the individual, is a virtual distinction, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
a logical distinction with a ground for it in the reality. This is
the sort of distinction which exists between the specific nature of

the individual <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span>. But though these characteristics enable
us to mark off the individual in space and time from other individuals
of the same class, thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">revealing</span></em> individuality to us in
the concrete, it cannot be held that they constitute the individuality
of the nature or substance in each case. If the human
substance, essence, or nature, as found in Socrates, were held to
differ from the human substance, essence, or nature, as found in
Plato, only by the fact that in each it is affected by a different
set of accidents, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of modes accidental to the substance as found
in each, then it would follow that this substance is not merely
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conceptually</span></em> identical in both, but that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> identical in
both; which is the error of extreme realism. As a matter of
fact it is the converse that is true: the sets of accidents are
distinct because they affect individual substances already really
and individually distinct.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is manifest that the accidents which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">separable</span></em> from the
individual substance, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> name, shape, size, appearance, location,
etc., cannot constitute its individuality. There are, however,
other characteristics which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inseparable</span></em> from the individual
substance, or which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">properties</span></em> of the latter, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the fact that an
individual man was born of certain parents. Perhaps it is such
characteristics that give its individuality to the individual substance?<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a>
To think so would be to misunderstand the question
under discussion. We are not now inquiring into the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em>
causes whereby actually existing reality is individuated, into the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> principles of its individuation, but into the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em> principle of the latter. There must obviously be something
intrinsic to the individual reality itself whereby it is individuated.
And it is about this intrinsic something we are inquiring.
The individual man is this individual, human nature is thus
individuated in him, by something that is essential to human
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nature as found in him. This something has been called—after
the analogy of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia specifica</span></span> which differentiates species
within a genus—the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia individua</span></span> of the individual. It
has also been called by some the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia numerica</span></span>, and by
Scotists the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">haecceitas</span></span>. However we are to conceive this something,
it is certain at all events that, considered as it is really
found in the individual, it cannot be anything <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really distinct</span></em> from
the specific nature of the latter. No doubt, the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia
specifica</span></span>, considered in the abstract, it is not essential and intrinsic
to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura generica</span></span> considered in the abstract: it is extrinsic
and accidental to the abstract content of the latter notion; but
this is because we are conceiving these grades of being in the
abstract. The same is true of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia individua</span></span> as compared
with the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura specifica</span></span> in the abstract. But we are
now considering these grades of reality as they are actually in
the concrete individual being: and as they are found here, we
have seen that a real distinction between them is inadmissible.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

32. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">“</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Principle of Individuation</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">”</span></span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">.</span></span>—How, then, are
we to conceive this something which individuates reality? It
may be well to point out that for the erroneous doctrine of
extreme realism, which issues in monism, the problem of individuation,
as here understood, does not arise. For the monist all plurality
in being is merely apparent, not real: there can be no question
of a real distinction between individual and individual.<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a> Similarly,
the nominalist and the conceptualist evade the problem.
For these the individual alone is not merely formally real: it
alone is fundamentally real: the universal is not even fundamentally
real, has no foundation in reality, and thus all scientific
knowledge of reality as revealed in sense experience is rendered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
impossible. But for the moderate realist, while the individual
alone is formally real, the universal is fundamentally real, and
hence the problem arises. It may be forcibly stated in the form
of a paradox: That whereby Socrates and Plato are really distinct
from each other as individuals is really identical with the
human nature which is really in both. But what individuates
human nature in Socrates, or in Plato, is logically distinct from
the human nature that is really in Socrates, and really in Plato.
We have only to inquire, therefore, whether the intrinsic principle
of individuation is to be conceived merely as a negation, as something
negative added by the mind to the concept of the specific
nature, whereby the latter is apprehended as incapable of multiplication
into <span class="tei tei-q">“others”</span> each of which would be formally that same
nature, or, in other words, as incommunicable; or is the intrinsic
ground of this incommunicability to be conceived as something
positive, not indeed as something really distinct from, and superadded
to, the specific nature, but as a positive aspect of the latter,
an aspect, moreover, not involved in the concept of the specific
nature considered in the abstract.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the many views that have been put forward on this
question two or three call for some attention. In the opinion of
Thomists generally, the principle which individuates <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em>
things, thus multiplying numerically the same specific nature, is
to be conceived as a positive mode affecting the latter and revealing
it in a new aspect, whereas the specific nature of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritual</span></em>
individual is itself formally an individual. The principle of the
latter's individuation is already involved in the very concept of its
specific nature, and therefore is not to be conceived as a distinct
positive aspect of the latter but simply as the absence of plurality
and communicability in the latter. In material things, moreover,
the positive mode or aspect whereby the specific nature is found
numerically multiplied, and incommunicable as it exists in each,
consists in the fact that such a specific nature involves in its very
constitution a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> principle which is actually allied with
certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantitative dimensions</span></em>. Hence the principle which
individuates material substances is not to be conceived—after the
manner in which Scotists conceive it—as an ultimate <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia</span></span>
affecting the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> factor of the nature, determining the specific
nature just as the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia specifica</span></span> determines the generic nature,
but as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> differentiating principle. What individuates
the material individual, what marks it off as one in itself, distinct
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or divided from other individuals of the same specific nature, and
incommunicable in that condition, is the material factor of that
individual's nature—not, indeed, the material factor, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia
prima</span></span>, considered in the abstract, but the material factor as
proximately capable of actual existence by being allied to certain
more or less definite spatial or quantitative dimensions: <span class="tei tei-q">“matter
affected with quantity”</span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia quantitate signata</span></span>”</span>.<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In regard to material substances this doctrine embraces two
separate contentions: (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) that the principle which individuates
such a substance must be conceived as something positive, not
really distinct from, but yet not contained in, the specific nature
considered in the abstract; (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) that this positive aspect is to be
found not in the formal but in the material principle of the composite
corporeal substance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the former contention it might be objected that what
individuates the specific nature cannot be conceived as anything
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positive</span></em>, superadded to this nature: it cannot be anything <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em>
to the latter, for if it were, the individual would be only an
accidental unity, a <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">unum per accidens</span></span>”</span> and would be constituted
by an accident, which we have seen to be inadmissible; nor, on
the other hand, can it be anything <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> to the specific nature,
for if it were, then individuals should be capable of adequate
essential definition, and furthermore the definition of the specific
nature would not really give the whole essence or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quidditas</span></span> of
the individuals—two consequences which are commonly rejected
by all scholastics. To this, however, it is replied that the
principle of individuation is something essential to the specific
nature in the sense that it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> something intrinsic to, and really
identical with, the whole real substance or entity of this nature,
though not involved in the abstract concept by the analysis of
which we reach the definition or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quidditas</span></span> of this nature. What
individuates Socrates is certainly essential to Socrates, and is
therefore really identical with his human nature; it is intrinsic to
the human nature in him, a mode or aspect of his human substance;
yet it does not enter into the definition of his nature—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">animal
rationale</span></em>”</span>—for such definition abstracts from individuality.
When, therefore, we say that definition of the specific nature
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gives the whole <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essence</span></em> of an individual, we mean that it gives
explicitly the abstract (specific) essence, not the individuality
which is really identical with this, nor, therefore, the whole substantial
reality of the individual. We give different answers to
the questions, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is Socrates?”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is Socrates?”</span>
The answer to the former question—a <span class="tei tei-q">“man,”</span> or a <span class="tei tei-q">“rational
animal”</span>—gives the <span class="tei tei-q">“essence,”</span> but not explicitly the whole
substantial reality of the individual, this remaining incapable of
adequate conceptual analysis. The latter question we answer by
giving the notes that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reveal</span></em> individuality. These, of course, are
<span class="tei tei-q">“accidental”</span> in the strict sense. But even the principles which
constitute the individuality of separate individuals of the same
species, and which differentiate these individuals numerically from
one another, we do not describe as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> differences, whereas
we do describe specific and generic differences as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em>. The
reason of this is that the latter are abstract, universal, conceptual,
amenable to intellectual analysis, scientifically important, while
the former are just the reverse; the universal differences alone
are principles about which we can have scientific knowledge,
for <span class="tei tei-q">“all science is of the abstract and universal”</span>;<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> and this is
what we have in mind when we describe them as <span class="tei tei-q">“essential”</span>
or <span class="tei tei-q">“formal,”</span> and individual differences as <span class="tei tei-q">“entitative”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“material”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second point in the Thomistic doctrine is that corporeal
substances are individuated by reason of their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">materiality</span></em>. The
formative, specific, determining principle of the corporeal substance
is rendered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incommunicable</span></em> by its union with the material,
determinable principle; and it becomes individually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinct</span></em> or
separate by the fact that this latter principle, in order to be capable
of union with the given specific form, has in its very essence
an exigence for certain more or less determinate dimensions in
space. Corporeal things have their natural size within certain
limits. The individual of a given corporeal species can exist only
because the material principle, receptive of this specific form, has
a natural relation to the fundamental property of corporeal things,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> quantity, within certain more or less determinate limits.
The form is rendered incommunicable by its reception in the
matter. This concrete realization of the form in the matter is
individually distinct and separate from other realizations of the
same specific form, by the fact that the matter of this realization
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
demands certain dimensions of quantity: this latter property
being the root-principle of numerical multiplication of corporeal
individuals within the same species.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, incorporeal substances such as angels or
pure spirits, being <span class="tei tei-q">“pure”</span> forms, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formæ subsistentes</span></span>,”</span> wholly
and essentially unallied with any determinable material principle,
are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of themselves</span></em> not only specific but individual; they are themselves
essentially incommunicable, superior to all multiplication
or repeated realization of themselves: they are such that each
can be actualized only <span class="tei tei-q">“once and for all”</span>: each is a species in
itself: it is the full, exhaustive, and adequate expression of a
divine type, of an exemplar in the Divine Mind: its realization is
not, like that of a material form, the actuation of an indefinitely
determinable material principle: it sums up and exhausts the imitable
perfection of the specific type in its single individuality,
whereas the perfection of the specific type of a corporeal thing
cannot be adequately expressed in any single individual realization,
but only by repeated realizations; nor indeed can it ever be
adequately, exhaustively expressed, by any finite multitude of
these.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It follows that in regard to pure spirits the individuating
principle and the specific principle are not only really but also
logically, conceptually identical; that the distinction between
individual and individual is here properly a specific distinction;
that it can be described as numerical only in an analogical sense,
if by numerical we mean material or quantitative, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the distinction
between corporeal individuals of the same species (<a href="#Section_28" class="tei tei-ref">28</a>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the distinction between individual human souls is not a
specific or formal distinction. These, though spiritual, are not
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure</span></em> spirits. They are spiritual substances which, of their very
nature, are essentially ordained for union with matter. They
all belong to the same species—the human species. But they do
not constitute individuals of this species unless as existing actually
united with matter. Each human soul has a transcendental
relation to its own body, to the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia signata</span></span>”</span> for which, and
in which, it was created. For each human soul this relation is
unique. Just as it is the material principle of each human being,
the matter as allied to quantitative dimensions, that individuates
the man, so it is the unique relation of his soul to the material
principle thus spatially determined, that individuates his soul.
Now the soul, even when disembodied and existing after death,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
necessarily retains in its very constitution this essential relation
to its own body; and thus it is that disembodied souls, though
not actually allied with matter, remain numerically distinct and
individuated in virtue of their essential relation, each to its own
body. We see, therefore, that human souls, though spiritual,
are an entirely different order of beings, and must be conceived
quite differently, from pure spirits.

principle of individuation, goes much deeper. It is intimately connected with
the Aristotelian theory of knowledge and reality. According to this philosophy
the formative principle or ἔιδος, the </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">forma subtantialis</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, is our sole key to the
intelligibility of corporeal things: these are intelligible in so far forth as they
are actual, and they are actual in virtue of their </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">forms</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. Hence the
tendency of the scholastic commentators of Aristotle to use the term </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">form</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> as

though it does, we can understand nothing about this </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">nature</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> beyond what is

hand, is the potential, indeterminate principle, in itself unintelligible. We
know that in ancient Greek philosophy it was regarded as the ἄλογον, the
surd and contingent principle in things, the element which resisted rational
analysis and fell outside the scope of </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">science,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> or </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">knowledge of the
necessary and universal</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. While it revealed the forms or natures of things
to sense, it remained itself impervious to intellect, which grasped these
natures and rendered them intelligible only by divesting them of matter, by
abstracting them from matter. Reality is intelligible only in so far forth as
it is immaterial, either in fact or by abstraction. The human intellect, being
itself spiritual, is </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">receptive of forms without matter</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. But being itself
allied with matter, its proper object is none other than the natures or essences
of corporeal things, abstracted, however, from the matter in which they are
actually </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">immersed</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. The only reason, therefore, why any intelligible form

with a material principle. It is the latter that accounts for the numerical
multiplication, in actual reality, of any intelligible form or essence. If the
latter is material it can be actualized only by indefinitely repeated, numerically
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">

It is, therefore, the material principle
that not merely reveals, but also constitutes, the individuation of such corporeal
forms or essences. Hence, too, the individual as such cannot be adequately
apprehended by intellect; for all intelligible principles of reality are formal,
whereas the individuating principle is material.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
On the other hand, if an intelligible essence or form be purely spiritual,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
In this solution of the question it is not easy to see how the material
principle, which, by its alliance with quantity, individuates the form, is itself
individuated so as to be the source and principle of a multiplicity of numerically
distinct and incommunicable realizations of this form. Perhaps the
most that can be said on this point is that we must conceive quantity, which
is the fundamental property of corporeal reality, as being itself essentially
divisible, and the material principle as deriving from its essential relation to
quantity its function of multiplying the same specific nature numerically.

Of those who reject the Thomistic doctrine some few contend
that it is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual existence</span></em> of any specific nature that should be
conceived as individuating the latter. No doubt the universal
as such cannot exist; reality in order to exist actually must be
individual. Yet it cannot be actual existence that individuates it.
We must conceive it as individual before conceiving it as actually
existent; and we can conceive it as individual while abstracting
from its existence. We can think, for instance, of purely possible
individual men, or angels, as numerically or individually distinct
from one another. Moreover, what individuates the nature must be
essential to the latter, but actual existence is not essential to any
finite nature. Hence actual existence cannot be the principle of
individuation.<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a> Can it be contended that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possible</span></em> existence is what
individuates reality? No; for possible existence is nothing more
than intrinsic capacity to exist actually, and this is essential to
all reality: it is the criterion whereby we distinguish real being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from logical being; but real being, as such, is indifferent to universality
or individuality; as far as the simple concept of real
being is concerned the latter may be either universal or individual;
the concept abstracts equally from either condition of
being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The vast majority, therefore, of those who reject the Thomistic
doctrine on individuation, support the view that what individuates
any nature or substance is simply the whole reality,
the total entity, of the individual. This total entity of the individual,
though really identical with the specific nature, must be
conceived as something positive, superadded to the latter, for it
involves a something which is logically or mentally distinct from
the latter. This something is what we conceive as a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia
individua</span></span>, after the analogy of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia specifica</span></span> which contracts
the concept of the genus to that of the species; and by
Scotists it has been termed <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">haecceitas</span></span>”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“thisness”</span>. Without
using the Scotist terminology, most of those scholastics who
reject the Thomist doctrine on this point advocate the present
view. The individuality or <span class="tei tei-q">“thisness”</span> of the individual substance
is regarded as having no special principle in the individual,
other than the whole substantial entity of the latter. If the
nature is simple it is of itself individual; if composite, the intrinsic
principles from which it results—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> matter and form
essentially united—suffice to individuate it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this view, therefore, the material principle of any individual
man, for example, is numerically and individually distinct from
that of any other individual, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of itself</span></em> and independently of its
relation either to the formative principle or to quantity. The
formative principle, too, is individuated <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of itself</span></em>, and not by the
material principle which is really distinct from it, or by its relation
to this material principle. Likewise the union of both
principles, which is a substantial mode of the composite substance,
is individuated and rendered numerically distinct from all other
unions of these two individual principles, not by either or both
these, but by itself. And finally, the individual composite substance
has its individuation from these two intrinsic principles
thus individually united.

33. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Individuation of Accidents.</span></span>—The rôle of quantity

How are accidents themselves individuated? We have referred
already (<a href="#Section_29" class="tei tei-ref">29</a>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">n.</span></span>) to the view that they are individuated by the individual

kind are found in individually distinct subjects what reveals the
numerical distinction between the former is the fact that they are
found inhering in the latter. So, also, distinction of individual
substances is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genetic</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causal</span></em> principle of the

substances. But when the same kind of accident recurs successively
in the same individual substance—as, for example, when a

numerical or individual distinction between these latter cannot be
the individual substance, for it is one and the same, but rather
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em> distinction between the accidents themselves.

The intrinsic constitutive principle which formally individuates
the accidents of individually distinct substances is, according
to Thomists generally, their essential relation to the individual
substances in which they appear. It is not clear how this theory
can be applied to the fundamental accident of corporeal substances.
If the function of formally individuating the corporeal substance
itself is to be ascribed in any measure to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantity</span></em>, it would seem
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to follow that this latter must be regarded as individuated by
itself, by its own total entity or reality. And this is the view
held by most other scholastics in regard to the individuation of
accidents generally: that these, like substances, are individuated
by their own total positive reality.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When there is question of the same kind of accident recurring
in the same individual subject, the <span class="tei tei-q">“time”</span> distinction
between such successive individual accidents of the same kind
would appear not merely to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reveal</span></em> their individuality but also to
indicate a different relation of each to its subject as existing at
that particular point of space and time: so that the relation of
the accident to its individual subject, as here and now existing in
the concrete, would be the individuating principle of the
accident.

Whether a number of accidents of the same <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">species infima</span></span>,
and distinct merely numerically, could exist simultaneously in
the same individual subject, is a question on which scholastic
philosophers are not agreed: the negative opinion, which has
the authority of St. Thomas, being the more probable. Those
various questions on the individuation of accidents will be better
understood from a subsequent exposition of the scholastic doctrine
on accidents (Ch. <a href="#Chapter_VIII" class="tei tei-ref">viii.</a>).

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
It may be well to remark that in inquiring about the individuation of
substances and accidents we have been considering reality from a static
standpoint, seeking how we are to conceive and interpret intellectually, or
for abstract thought, the relation of the universal to the individual. If, however,
we ascribe to </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">time</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> distinctions any function in individuating accidents
of the same kind in the same individual substance, we are introducing into
our analysis the kinetic aspect of reality, or its subjection to processes of
change.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
We may call attention here to a few other questions of minor import discussed
by scholastics. First, have all individuals of the same species the
same </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">substantial</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> perfection, or can individuals have different grades of substantial
perfection within the same species? All admit the obvious fact that
individual differs from individual within the same species in the number,
variety, extent and intensity of their accidental properties and qualities. But,
having the human soul mainly in view, they disagree as to whether the
substantial perfection of the specific nature can be actualized in different
grades in different individuals. According to the more common opinion
there cannot be different </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">substantial</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> grades of the same specific nature, for
the simple reason that every such grade of substantial perfection should be
regarded as specific, as changing the species: hence, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> all human souls
are substantially equal in perfection. This view is obviously based upon
the conception of specific types or essences as being, after the analogy of
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
numbers, immutable when considered in the abstract. And it seems to be
confirmed by the consideration that the intrinsic principle of individuation is
nothing, or adds nothing, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">really distinct</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> from the specific essence itself.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Another question in connexion with individuation has derived at least
an historical interest from the notable controversy to which it gave rise in
the seventeenth century between Clarke and Leibniz. The latter, in accordance
with the principles of his system of philosophy,—the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Law of Sufficient Reason</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
and the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Law of Continuity</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> among the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">monads</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> or ultimate principles of
being,—contended that two individual beings so absolutely alike as to be
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">indiscernible</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> would be </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">eo ipso identical</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, in other words, that the reality of
two such beings is impossible.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Of course if we try to conceive two individuals so absolutely alike both
in essence and accidents, both in the abstract and in the concrete, as to be
indiscernible either by our senses or by our intellect, or by any intellect—even
the Divine Intellect—we are simply conceiving </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">the same thing</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> twice
over. But is there anything impossible or contradictory in thinking that God
could create two perfectly similar beings, distinct from each other only
individually, so similar, however, that neither human sense nor human
intellect could apprehend them as two, but only as one? The impossibility
is not apparent. Were they two material individuals they should, of course,
occupy the same space in order to have similar spatial relations, but
impenetrability is not essential to corporeal substances. And even in the
view that each is individuated by its </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">materia signata</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> it is not impossible
to conceive numerically distinct quantified matters allied at the same time to
the same dimensions of space. If, on the other hand, there be question of
two pure spirits, absolutely similar specifically, even in the Thomistic view
that here the individual distinction is at the same time specific there seems to
be no sufficient ground for denying that the Divine Omnipotence could create
two or more such individually (and therefore specifically) distinct spirits:</span><a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> such
distinction remaining, of course, indiscernible for the finite human intellect.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The argument of Leibniz, that there would be </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">no sufficient reason</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> for
the creation of two such indiscernible beings, and that it would therefore be
repugnant to the Divine Wisdom, is extrinsic to the question of their intrinsic
possibility: if they be intrinsically possible they cannot be repugnant to any
attribute of the Divinity, either to the Divine Omnipotence or to the Divine
Wisdom.

34. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Identity.</span></span>—Considering the order in which we acquire our
ideas we are easily convinced that the notion of finite being is
antecedent to that of infinite being. Moreover, it is from reflection
on finite beings that we arrive at the most abstract
notion of being in general. We make the object of this latter
notion definite only by dividing it off mentally from nothingness,
conceived <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per modum entis</span></span>, or as an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span>. Thus the
natural way of making our concepts definite is by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">limiting</span></em> them;
it is only when we come to reflect on the necessary implications
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of our concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“infinite being”</span> that we realize the possibility
of conceiving a being which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">definite</span></em> without being
really <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">limited</span></em>, which is definite by the very fact of its infinity, by
its possession of unlimited perfection; and even then our imperfect
human mode of conceiving <span class="tei tei-q">“infinite being”</span> is helped by
distinguishing or dividing it off from all finite being and contrasting
it with the latter. All this goes to prove the truth of
the teaching of St. Thomas, that the mental function of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dividing</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinguishing</span></em> precedes our concepts of unity and multitude.
Now the concepts of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identity</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinction</span></em> are closely allied
with those of unity and multitude; but they add something to
these latter. When we think of a being as one we must analyse
it further, look at it under different aspects, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">compare it with
itself</span></em>, before we can regard it as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the same</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identical</span></em> with itself.
Or, at least, we must think of it twice and compare it with itself
in the affirmative judgment <span class="tei tei-q">“This is itself,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“A is A,”</span> thus
formulating the logical <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Principle of Identity</span></em>, in order to come
into possession of the concept of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identity</span></em>.<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href="#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a> Every affirmative
categorical judgment asserts <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identity</span></em> of the predicate with the
subject (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">S is P</span></em>”</span>): asserts, in other words, that what we apprehend
under the notion of the predicate (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">P</span></em>) is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really identical</span></em> with
what we have apprehended under the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinct</span></em> notion of the
subject (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">S</span></em>). The synthetic function of the affirmative categorical
judgment <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identifies</span></em> in the real order what the analytic function of
mental abstraction had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">separated</span></em> in the logical order. By saying
that the affirmative categorical judgment asserts identity we
mean that by asserting that <span class="tei tei-q">“this is that,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“man is rational”</span> we
identify <span class="tei tei-q">“this”</span> with <span class="tei tei-q">“that,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span> with <span class="tei tei-q">“rational,”</span> thus
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">denying</span></em> that they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em>, that they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinct</span></em>, that they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">differ</span></em>.
Identity is one of those elementary concepts which cannot be
defined; but perhaps we may describe it as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the logical relation
through which the mind asserts the objects of two or more of its
thoughts to be really one</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the object formally represented by each of the concepts is
one and the same—as, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> when we compare <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">A</span></em>”</span> with <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">A</span></em>,”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span> with <span class="tei tei-q">“rational animal,”</span> or, in general, any object with
its definition—the identity is both <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real and logical</span></em> (or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conceptual</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em>). If the concepts differ in their formal objects while
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
representing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one and the same reality</span></em>—as when we compare
<span class="tei tei-q">“St. Peter”</span> with <span class="tei tei-q">“head of the apostles,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span> with <span class="tei tei-q">“rational”</span>—the
identity is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real, but not logical</span></em> or formal. Finally, if we
represent two or more realities, <span class="tei tei-q">“John, James, Thomas,”</span> by the
same formal concept, <span class="tei tei-q">“man,”</span> the identity is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">merely logical</span></em> or
formal, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not real</span></em>. Of these three kinds of identity the first is sometimes
called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adequate</span></em>, the second and third <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inadequate</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Logical identity may be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specific</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generic</span></em>, according as we
identify really distinct individuals under one specific concept, or
really distinct species or classes under one generic concept.
Again, it may be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em>, according as the abstract
and universal class-concept under which really distinct members
are classified represents a common part of the essence of these
members or only a common property or accident. Thus John,
James and Thomas are essentially identical in their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">human nature</span></em>;
they are accidentally identical in being all three <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fair-haired</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">six feet in height</span></em>. Logical identity under the concept of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quality</span></em>
is based on the real relation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">similarity</span></em>; logical identity under
the concept of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantity</span></em> is based on the real relation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">equality</span></em>.
When we say that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> (logical) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identity</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the identity of
John, James and Thomas under the concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span>) is based
on the fact that the really distinct individuals have really <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">similar</span></em>
natures, we merely mean that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> knowledge of natures or
essences is derived from our knowledge of qualities, taking
<span class="tei tei-q">“qualities”</span> in the wide sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“accidents”</span> generally: that the
properties and activities of things are our only key to the nature
of these things: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Operari sequitur esse.</span></span> It is not implied, nor is
it true, that real <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">similarity</span></em> is a partial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real identity</span></em>: it is but the
ground of a partial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical</span></em> identity,—identity under the common
concept of some quality (in the wide sense of this term). For
example, the height of John is as really distinct from that of
James as the humanity of John is from that of James. If, then,
individual things are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> distinct, how is it that we can represent
(even inadequately) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a multitude</span></em> of them by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> concept?
To say that we can do so because they reveal themselves to us
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">similar</span></em> to one another is to say what is undoubtedly true;
but this does not solve the problem of the relation between the
universal and the individual in human experience: rather it
places us face to face with this problem.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Reverting now to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> identity: whatever we can predicate
affirmatively about a being considered as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>, and as subject of a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
judgment, we regard as really identical with that being. We
cannot predicate a real part of its real whole, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>. But
our concepts, when compared together in judgment, bear <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical</span></em>
relations of extension and intension to each other, that is, relations
of logical part to logical whole. Thus, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical</span></em> identity of
subject and predicate in the affirmative judgment may be only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inadequate</span></em>.<a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href="#note_152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">152</span></span></a>
But the real identity underlying the affirmative judgment
is an adequate real identity. When we say, for example,
that <span class="tei tei-q">“Socrates is wise,”</span> we mean that the object of our concept
of <span class="tei tei-q">“wisdom”</span> is in this case really and adequately identical with
the object of our concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“Socrates”</span>: in other words that
we are conceiving one and the same real being under two distinct
concepts, each of which represents, more or less adequately,
the whole real being, and one of them in this case less adequately
than the other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have to bear in mind that while considering being as one
or manifold, identical or distinct, we are thinking of it in its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">static</span></em>
mode, as an object of abstract thought, not in its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dynamic and
kinetic</span></em> mode as actually existing in space and time, and subject
to change. It is the identity of being with itself when considered
in this static, unchanging condition, that is embodied in the
logical <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Principle of Identity</span></em>. In order, therefore, that this
principle may find its application to being or reality <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as subject to
actual change</span></em>—and this is the state in which <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> reality is
presented to us as an immediate datum of experience—we must
seize upon the changing reality and think of it in an indivisible
instant apart from the change to which it is actually subject;
only thus does the Principle of Identity apply to it—as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em>, not
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">becoming</span></em>, not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in fieri</span></span>, but <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in facto esse</span></span>. The Principle of
Identity, which applies to all real being, whether possible or
actual, tells us simply that <span class="tei tei-q">“a thing is what it is”</span>. But for the
understanding of actual being as subject to real change we must
supplement the Principle of Identity by another principle which
tells us that such an actual being not only is actually what it is
(Principle of Identity), but also that it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is potentially something
other than what it actually is, that it is potentially what it can
become actually</span></em> (Ch. ii.).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have seen that, since change is not continuous annihilation
and creation, the changing being must in some real and
true sense <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">persist</span></em> throughout the process of change. It is from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
experience of change we derive our notion of time-duration; and
the concept of permanence or stability throughout change gives
us the notion of a real sameness or abiding self-identity which is
compatible with real change. But a being which persists in existence
is identical with itself throughout its duration only in
so far forth as it has not changed. Only the Necessary Being,
whose duration is absolutely exempt from all change, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metaphysically</span></em> identical with Himself: His duration
is eternity—which is one perpetual, unchanging <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em>. A being
which persists unchanged in its essence or nature, which
is exempt from substantial change, but which is subject to
accidental change, to a succession of accidental qualities such
as vital actions—such a being is said to retain its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em>
identity with itself throughout those changes. Such, for instance,
is the identity of the human soul with itself, or of any
individual living thing during its life, or even of an inorganic
material substance as long as it escapes substantial change.
Finally, the persisting identity of a collection of beings, united
by some moral bond so as to form a moral unit, is spoken of as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em> identity as long as the bond remains, even though the constituent
members may be constantly disappearing to be replaced
by others: as in a nation, a religious society, a legal corporation,
etc.

it is the absence or negation of the latter. We express the relation
called distinction by the negative judgment, <span class="tei tei-q">“this is not

object, or only from a part of itself. For example, the distinction
between John and James is an adequate real distinction, while

adequate logical distinction, while the distinction between either

logical; the sub-division of the latter into purely logical and
virtual; and of the latter again into perfect (complete, adequate)
and imperfect (incomplete, inadequate). But the theory there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
briefly outlined calls for some further analysis and amplification.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
36. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Logical Distinctions and their Grounds.</span></span>—The
purely logical distinction must not be confounded with a mere
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">verbal</span></em> distinction, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> that between an <span class="tei tei-q">“edifice”</span> and a <span class="tei tei-q">“building,”</span>
or between <span class="tei tei-q">“truthfulness”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“veracity”</span>. A logical distinction
is a distinction <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the concepts</span></em>: these must represent one and the
same reality but in different ways: the one may be more explicit,
more fully analysed than the other, as a definition is in comparison
with the thought-object defined; or the one may represent
the object less adequately than the other, as when we compare
(in intension) the concepts <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“animal”</span>; or the one
may be predicated of the other in an affirmative judgment; or
the one may represent the object as concrete and individual, the
other the same object as abstract and universal.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Comparing, in the next place, the purely logical with the
virtual distinction, we see that the grounds for making these distinctions
are different. Every distinction made by the mind
must have an intelligible ground or reason of some sort—a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fundamentum
distinctionis</span></span>. Now in the case of the purely logical
distinction the ground is understood to consist exclusively in the
needs of the mind itself—needs which spring from the mind's
own limitations when confronted with the task of understanding or
interpreting reality, of making reality intelligible. Purely logical
distinctions are therefore seen to be a class of purely logical relations,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of those <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span> which the mind must construct
for itself in its effort to understand the real. They have no other
reality as objects of thought than the reality they derive from the
constitutive or constructive activity of the mind. They are
modes, or forms, or terms, of the cognitive activity itself, not of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the reality which is the object apprehended and contemplated by
means of this cognitive activity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The virtual distinction, on the other hand, although it also,
as an object of thought, is only an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span>—inasmuch as
there is no real duality or plurality corresponding to it in the
reality into which the mind introduces it, this reality being a real
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unity</span></em>—the virtual distinction is considered, nevertheless, to have
a ground, or reason, or foundation (for making and introducing
it) in the nature of this one reality; that is, it is regarded as
having a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> foundation, a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fundamentum in re</span></span>. In so far, therefore,
as our knowledge is permeated by virtual distinctions, reality
cannot be said to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em>, but only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fundamentally</span></em> what this
knowledge represents it to be. Does this fact interfere with the
objective validity of our knowledge? Not in the least; for we
do not ascribe to the reality the distinctions, and other such
modes or forms, which we know by reflection to be formally
characteristic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not of things</span></em> but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of our thought or cognition of things</span></em>.
Our knowledge, therefore, so far as it goes, may be a faithful apprehension
of reality, even though it be itself affected by modes
not found in the reality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But what is this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> foundation of the virtual distinction?
What <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fundamentum in re</span></span>? It is not a real or objective
duality in virtue of which we could say that there are, in the object
of our thought, two beings or realities one of which is not
the other. Such duality would cause a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> distinction. But
just here the difficulties of our analysis begin to arise: for we
have to fix our attention on actually existing realities; and, assuming
that each and every one of these is an individual, we
have to bear in mind the relation of the real to the actual, of
reality as abstract and universal to reality as concrete and individual,
of the simple to the composite, of the stable to the changing,
of essential to accidental unity—in any and every attempt
to discriminate in detail between a real and a virtual distinction.
Nor is it easy to lay down any general test which will serve even
theoretically to discriminate between them. Let us see what
grounds have been mainly suggested as real foundations for the
virtual distinction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If a being which is not only one but simple, manifests, in the
superior grade of being to which it belongs, a perfection which
is equivalent to many lesser perfections found really distinct and
separate elsewhere, in separate beings of an inferior order, this is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
considered a sufficient real ground for considering the former
being, though really one and simple, as virtually manifold.<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a>
The human soul, as being virtually threefold—rational, sentient
and vegetative—is a case in point: but only on the assumption
that the soul of the individual man can be proved to be one and
simple. This, of course, all scholastics regard as capable of
proof: even those of them who hold that the powers or faculties
whereby it immediately manifests these three grades of perfection
are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em> realities, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really distinct</span></em> from one another and from
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em> of the soul itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, the being which is the object of our thought may be
so rich in reality or perfection that our finite minds cannot
adequately grasp it by any one mental intuition, but must proceed
discursively, by analysis and abstraction, taking in partial
aspects of it successively through inadequate concepts; while
realizing that these aspects, these objects of our distinct concepts,
are only partial aspects of one and the same real being. This,
in fact, is our common experience. But the theory assumes that
we are able to determine when these objects of our concepts are
only mental aspects of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> reality, and when they are several
separate realities; nay, even, that we can determine whether or
not they are really distinct entities united together to form one
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">composite</span></em> individual being, or only mentally distinct views of
one <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simple</span></em> individual being. For example, it is assumed that
while the distinction between the sentient and the rational grades
of being in a human individual can be shown to be only a virtual
distinction, that between the body and the soul of the same
individual can be shown to be a real distinction; or, again, that
while the distinction between essence, intellect, and will in God,
can be shown to be only a virtual distinction, that between
essence, intellect, and will in man, can be shown to be a real
distinction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
37. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Virtual Distinction and the Real Distinction.</span></span>—Now
scholastics differ considerably in classifying this,
that, or the other distinction, as logical or as real; but this does
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not prove that it is impossible ever to determine with certitude
whether any particular distinction is logical or real. What we
are looking for just now is a general test for discriminating, if
such can be found. And this brings us to a consideration of the
test suggested in the very definitions themselves. At first sight
it would appear to be an impracticable, if not even an unintelligible
test: <span class="tei tei-q">“The distinction is real if it exists in the reality—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
if the reality is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> (or more) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beings</span></em>, not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one being</span></em>—antecedently
to, or independently of, the consideration of the mind;
otherwise the distinction is logical”</span>. But—it might be objected—how
can we possibly know whether or not any object of perception
or thought is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more than one</span></em> antecedently to, or
independently of, the consideration of the mind? It is certainly
impossible for us to know what, or what kind, reality is, or
whether it is one or manifold, apart from and prior to, the
exercise of our own cognitive activity. This, therefore, cannot
be what the test means: to interpret it in such a sense would be
absurd. But when we have perceived reality in our actual sense
experience, when we have interpreted it, got the meaning of
it, made it intelligible, and actually understood it, by the spontaneous
exercise of intellect, the judging and reasoning faculty:
then, obviously, we are at liberty to reflect critically on those
antecedent spontaneous processes, on the knowledge which is
the result of them, and the reality which is known through them;
and by such critical reflection on those processes, their objects
and their products, on the <span class="tei tei-q">“reality as perceived and known”</span> and
on the <span class="tei tei-q">“perceiving”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“knowing”</span> of it, we may be able to
distinguish between two classes of contributions to the total
result which is the <span class="tei tei-q">“known reality”</span>: those which we must regard
as purely mental, as modes or forms or subjectively constructed
terms of the mental function of cognition itself (whether
perceptual or conceptual), and those which we must regard as
given or presented to the mind as objects, which are not in any
sense constructed or contributed by the mind, which, therefore,
are what they are independently of our mental activity, and
which would be and remain what they are, and what we have
apprehended them to be, even if we had never perceived or
thought of them. This, according to the scholastics, is the sense—and
it is a perfectly intelligible sense—in which we are called
on to decide whether the related terms of any given distinction
have been merely rendered distinct by the analytic activity of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the cognitive process, or are themselves distinct realities irrespective
of this process. That it is possible to carry on successfully, at
least to some extent, this work of discrimination between the
subjective and the objective factors of our cognitive experience,
can scarcely be denied. It is what philosophers in every age
have been attempting. There are, however, some distinctions
about the nature of which philosophers have never been able to
agree, some holding them to be real, others to be only virtual:
the former view being indicative of the tendency to emphasize
the rôle of cognition as a passive representation of objectively
given reality; the latter view being an expression of the opposite
tendency to emphasize the active or constitutive or constructive
factors whereby cognition assimilates to the mind's own mode of
being the reality given to it in experience. In all cognition there
is an assimilation of reality and mind, of object and subject.
When certain distinctions are held to be real this consideration
is emphasized: that in the cognitive process, as such, it is the
mind that is assimilated to the objective reality.<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a> When these
same distinctions are held to be logical this other consideration
is emphasized: that in the cognitive process reality must also
be assimilated to mind, must be mentalized so to speak:
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Cognitum est in cognoscente secundum modum cognoscentis</span></span>: that
in this process the mind must often regard what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> reality
under <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinct aspects</span></em>: and that if we regard these distinct aspects
as distinct realities we are violating the principle, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Entia non
sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Now those philosophers who hold certain distinctions to be virtual, and
not real, thereby ascribe to cognitive experience a larger sphere of constitutive
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
or constructive influence than would be allowed to it by advocates of the
reality of such distinctions. But by doing so are they to be regarded as calling
into question the objective validity of human knowledge? By no means:
the fact that the human mind can understand reality only by processes of
abstracting, generalizing, comparing, relating, analysing and synthesizing—processes
which involve the production of logical entities—in no way vitiates
the value of these modes of understanding: it merely indicates that they are
less perfect than intuitive modes of understanding which would dispense
with such logical entities,—the modes characteristic of pure, angelic intelligences,
or the knowledge of the Deity. The objective validity of
human cognition is not interfered with either by enlarging or by restricting the
domain of the mind's constitutive activity in forming such logical entities;
nor, therefore, by claiming that certain distinctions are real rather than
virtual, or </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. It must be remembered, moreover, that the virtual
distinction is not purely logical: it has a foundation in the reality, a </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">fundamentum
in re</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">; and in so far as it has it gives us an insight into the nature
of reality.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
No doubt, any particular distinction cannot be virtual and at the same
time simply real: either view of it must be erroneous: and possibly both, if
it happen to be </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">de facto</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">purely</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> logical distinction. But the error of confounding
a virtual distinction with a real is not so great as that of regarding
either as a purely logical distinction. Now the tendency of much modern
philosophy, under the influence of Kant, has been to regard all the categories
in which the mind apprehends reality as being wholly and exclusively
forms of cognition, as being in the reality neither formally nor even fundamentally;
and to infer from this an essential, constitutional inability of the
mind to attain to a valid knowledge of reality. But if, as a matter of fact,
these categories are in the reality formally, nay, even if they are in it only
fundamentally, the inference that issues in Kantian subjectivism is unwarranted.
And those categories we hold to be in the reality at least fundamentally;
we therefore reject the Kantian phenomenism of the speculative
reason. Moreover, we can see no valid ground for admitting the Kantian
division of the human mind into two totally separate cognitive compartments,
the speculative and the practical reason, and ascribing to each compartment
cognitive principles and capacities entirely alien to the other. To arrive at a
right theory of knowledge human cognitive experience as a whole must be
analysed; but provided the analysis is really an analysis of this experience
it may be legitimately directed towards discovering what the mental conditions
must be—</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> the conditions on the side of the knowing subject, the subject
having the experience—which are </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">necessarily prerequisite</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> for having such
experience. And if it be found by such analysis that cognitive experience
presupposes in the knowing subject not merely a sentient and intelligent mind,
but a mind which perceives, imagines, remembers reality in certain definite
ways; which thinks reality in certain modes and through certain forms which
by its own constitutive activity it constructs for itself, and which it recognizes
by reflection to be its own constructions (</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> distinctions, relations, affirmations
and negations, abstractions, generalizations, etc.: </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">intentiones logicae</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
logical entities),—there is no reason whatever in all this for inferring that because
the mind is so constituted, because it has these modes of cognition, it
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
must necessarily fail to reach, by means of them, a true, valid, and genuine
knowledge of reality. From the fact that human modes of cognition are
human, and not angelic or divine; from the fact that reality can be known
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">to man</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> only through these modes, these finite modes of finite human faculties,—we
may indeed infer that even our highest knowledge of reality is inadequate,
that it does not </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">comprehend</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> all that is in the reality, but surely not that it is
essentially illusory and of its very nature incapable of giving us any true and
valid insight into the nature of reality.

Fixing our attention on the virtual distinction we see that the
mind is supposed by means of it to apprehend, through a plurality
of distinct concepts, what it knows somehow or other to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
being. Now if it knows the reality to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really one</span></em>, it knows
that the formal object of every distinct concept of this reality is
really identical with the objects of all the other concepts of the
latter. This condition of things is certainly verified when the
mind can see that each of the distinct concepts, though not
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">explicitly</span></em> presenting the objects of the others, nevertheless <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">implicitly

implicitly, but present to the mind, so far as they themselves are

How do we know, in any given case of this kind, whether or not
these adequately distinct thought-objects are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identical with one

seems to be that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal and external sense experience</span></em> can and
does furnish us with embodiments of these intellectual manifolds,—embodiments
each of which we apprehend as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a being that is

It would appear, therefore, that we cannot reach a true conception of
what we are to regard as </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">really one</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, or </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">really manifold</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, by abstract thought

others, or being produced by others, really distinct from itself? In other
words, is separateness of existence in time or space, as revealed in sense
experience, a sufficient index of the real manifoldness of corporeal being, and
of the really distinct individuality of each such being?—or are we to take it
that because those space and time distinctions have to be apprehended by
thought in order that not merely sense but intellect may apprehend corporeal
beings as really manifold, therefore these distinctions are not </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">in the reality</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">

The philosophy which defends the validity of this distinction,—which
holds that the distinction between individual human beings, and between
individual living things generally, is in the fullest and truest sense a real distinction,—is
at all events in conformity with universally prevailing modes of
thought and language; while the monism which repudiates these spontaneous
interpretations of experience as invalid by denying all real manifoldness to
reality, can make itself intelligible only by doing violence to thought and
language alike. Not that this alone is a disproof of monism; but at all
events it creates a presumption against a system to find it running counter to
any of those universal spontaneous beliefs which appear to be rooted in man's
rational nature. On the other hand, the philosophy which accords with
common belief in proclaiming a real plurality in being has to reconcile intellect
with sense, and the universal with the individual, by solving the important
problem of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">individuation</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">: What is it that makes real being individual, if,
notwithstanding the fact that intellect apprehends reality as abstract and
universal, reality nevertheless can exist only as concrete and individual?

38. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Real Distinction.</span></span>—In the next place it must be
remembered, comparing the virtual distinction with the real,
that philosophers have recognized two kinds of real distinction:
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">major</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> real distinction, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">minor</span></em> real, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modal</span></em>
distinction. Before defining these let us see what are the usual
signs by which a real distinction in general can be recognized.
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The relation of efficient causality, of efficient cause and effect, between
two objects of thought, is sometimes set down as a sure sign of a (major) real
distinction between them.</span><a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> And the reason alleged is that a thing cannot be
the efficient cause of itself: the efficient cause is necessarily extrinsic to the
effect and cannot be really identical with the latter. It is to be noted that this
test applies to reality as actually existing, as producing or undergoing change,
and that it is derived from our sense experience of reality in process of change.
But since our concept of efficient causality has its origin in our internal experience
of our own </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">selves</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> as active agents, as causing some portion of what
enters into our experience, the test seems to assume that we have already
introduced into this experience a real distinction between the self and what is
caused by the self. It is not clear that the relation of efficient cause to effect,
as applied to created causes, can precede and reveal, in our experience, the
relation of what is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">really one</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> to what is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">really other</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, in this experience. If
the reality revealed to us in our direct experience, the phenomenal universe,
has been brought into existence by the creative act of a Supreme Being, this,
of course, implies a real distinction between Creator and creature. But it
does not seem possible in this case, or indeed in any case, to prove the existence
of the causal relation antecedently to that of the real distinction, or to
utilize the former as an index to the latter.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two distinct thought-objects are regarded as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> distinct
(1) when they are found to exist separately and apart from each
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other in time or space, as is the case with any two individuals
such as John and James, or a man and a horse; (2) when, although
they are found in the same individual, one of them at least is
separable from the other, in the sense that it can actually exist
without that other: for example, the soul of any individual man
can exist apart from the material principle with which it is actually
united to form this living human individual; the individual
himself can exist without the particular accidental modes, such
as sitting, thinking, speaking, which actually affect his being at
any particular instant of his existence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From this we can gather in the first place that the distinction
between two <span class="tei tei-q">“individuals,”</span>—individual <span class="tei tei-q">“persons”</span> or individual
<span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span>—is a real distinction in the fullest and plainest sense
of this expression, a major or absolute real distinction. It is,
moreover, not merely real but actual. Two existing <span class="tei tei-q">“individuals”</span>
are always actually divided and separate from each other, while
each is actually one or actually undivided in itself. And they
are so <span class="tei tei-q">“independently of the consideration of the mind”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the second place, assuming that the mind can apprehend,
in the individuals of its experience, a unity resulting from the
union or composition of separable factors or principles, whether
essential or accidental [<a href="#Section_27_b" class="tei tei-ref">27 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)</a>]; and assuming that it can know
these factors to be really separable (though actually one and
undivided), that is, separable in the sense that each of any two
such factors, or at least one of them, could actually exist without
the other,—it regards the distinction between such factors as real.
They are really distinct because though <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em> one and undivided
they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potentially</span></em> manifold. If each has a positive
entity of its own, so that absolutely speaking each could exist
without the other, the distinction is still regarded as an absolute
or major real distinction. For example, the human soul can
exist without the body; the body can exist without the soul,
being actualized by the new formative principle or principles
which replace the soul at death; therefore there is an absolute
real distinction between the soul and the body of the living
human individual: although both factors form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one actual being</span></em>,
still, independently of the consideration of the mind <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the one
factor is not the other</span></em>: each is really, though only potentially,
other than the factor with which it is united: the relation of
<span class="tei tei-q">“one”</span> to <span class="tei tei-q">“other”</span> though not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em> verified of either factor
(since there is only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one actual</span></em> being: the existing individual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man), is potentially and really verified, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">verifiable</span></em> of each.
Again, the individual corporeal substance can, absolutely speaking,
exist without its connatural accident of external or local extension;
this latter can, absolutely speaking, exist without its connatural
substance;<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href="#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a> therefore these are absolutely and really
distinct.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If only one of the factors is seen to be capable of existing
without the other, and the latter to be such that it could not
actually exist except as united with the former, so that the
separability is not mutual, the distinction is regarded still as real,
but only as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">minor</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modal</span></em> distinction. Such, for instance, is
the distinction between a body and its location, or its state of
rest or motion: and, in general, the distinction between a substance
and what are called its accidental modes or modal accidents.
The distinction is regarded as real because reflection is
held to assure us that it is in the reality itself independently of
the mind, and not merely imposed by the mind on the reality
because of some ground or reason in the reality. It is called a
modal distinction rather than an absolute real distinction because
those accidental modes of a substance do not seem to have of
themselves sufficient reality to warrant our calling them <span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span>
or <span class="tei tei-q">“realities,”</span> but rather merely <span class="tei tei-q">“modes”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“determinations”</span>
of things or realities. It is significant, as throwing light on the
relation of the virtual to the real distinction, that some authors
call the modal distinction not a real distinction but a <span class="tei tei-q">“distinctio
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">media</span></em>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> intermediate between a real and a logical distinction;
and that the question whether it should be called simply a real
distinction, or <span class="tei tei-q">“intermediate”</span> between a real and a logical distinction
is regarded by some as <span class="tei tei-q">“a purely verbal question.”</span><a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a>
We shall recur to the modal distinction later (<a href="#Section_68" class="tei tei-ref">68</a>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the third place it must be noted that separability <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the
sense explained</span></em>, even non-mutual, is not regarded as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>
index to a real distinction. In other words, certain distinctions
are held by some to be real even though this test of separability
does not apply. For instance, it is commonly held that not
merely in man but in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> corporeal individuals the formative and
the determinable principle of the nature or substance, the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma
substantialis</span></span> and the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia prima</span></span>, are really distinct, although
it is admitted that, apart from the case of the human soul, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">neither</span></em>
can actually exist except in union with the other. What is held
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in regard to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em> modes is also applied to these essential
principles of the corporeal substance: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> that there is here a
special reason why such principles cannot actually exist in isolation.
Of their very nature they are held to be such that they
cannot be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actualized</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually exist</span></em> in isolation, but only in
union. But this fact, it is contended, does not prove that the
principles in question are merely mentally distinct aspects of one
reality: the fact that they cannot actually exist as such separately
does not prove that they are not really separable; and it
is contended that they are really and actually separated whenever
an individual corporeal substance undergoes substantial change.

manifold of really distinct individual beings; and when we infer from sense-experience

space, may be in reality an aggregate of many individuals; and they recognized
the need of scrutinizing and analysing those apparent individuals in
order to test their real individuality; but they held, and rightly, that sense
experience does present to us some data that are unmistakably real individuals—individual
men, for instance. Next, they saw that intellectual
thought, by analysing sense experience, amasses an ever-growing multitude
of abstract and conceptually distinct thought-objects, which it utilizes as
predicates for the interpretation of this sense experience. These thought-objects
intellect can unite or separate; can in some cases positively see to be

as embodied in individuals (</span><a href="#Section_18" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">18</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">)—and when, furthermore, it now finds a number

This, as we have seen already, is the case for which it is really difficult to

makes or discovers </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">within the individual</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. The difficulty is this. The conceptual

show that any distinctions </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">within the individual</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> are real?
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Well, we have seen that certain entities, which are objects of sense or of
thought, or of both, can disappear from the individual without the residue
thereby perishing or ceasing to exist actually as an individual: the human
soul survives, as an actual individual reality, after its separation from the
material principle with which it formed the individual man; the individual
man persists while the accidental modes that affect him disappear. In such
cases as these, intellect, interpreting sense experience and reasoning from it,
places a real distinction, in the composite individual, between the factors that
can continue to exist without others, and these latter. In doing so it is apparently
applying the analogy of the typical real distinction—that between one
individual and another. The factor, or group of factors, which can continue
to exist actually after the separation of the others, is an individual: and what
were separated from it were apparently real entities, though they may have
perished by the actual separation. But on what ground is the distinction between
the material principle and the vital principle of a plant or an animal,
for example, regarded as real? Again on the ground furnished by the analogy
of the distinction between individuals of sense experience. Note that it
is not between the material and the vital principles </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">as objects of abstract
thought</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> between the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">materiality</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> and the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">vitality</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of the plant or the
animal, that a real distinction is claimed: these are regarded only as conceptually
distinct aspects of the plant or the animal; nor is it admitted that
because one of these thought-objects is found embodied elsewhere in nature
without the other—materiality without vitality in the inorganic universe—we
can therefore conclude that they are really distinct in the plant or the animal.
No; it is between the two principles conceived as coexisting and united in the
concrete individual that the real distinction is claimed. And it is held to be
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">

If it is real there is a real separation of essential factors when the individual
perishes. And the factors continue to be real, as </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">potential</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> principles of other

some scholastics hold that, absolutely speaking, they could be conserved

39. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Some Questionable Distinctions. The Scotist Distinction.</span></span>—The
difficulty of discriminating between the
virtual and the real distinction in an individual has given rise to
the conception of distinctions which some maintain to be real,
others to be less than real. The virtual distinction, as we have
hitherto understood it, may be described as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em> inasmuch as
it arises in the individual only when we consider the latter under
different aspects, or in different relations to things extrinsic to it.
By regarding an individual under different aspects—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> a man
under the aspects of animality and rationality—we can predicate
contradictory attributes of the individual, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> of a man that <span class="tei tei-q">“he
is similar to a horse,”</span> and that <span class="tei tei-q">“he is not similar to a horse”</span>.
Now it is maintained by some that although independently of
the consideration of the mind the grounds of these contradictory
predications are not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em> distinct in the individual, nevertheless
even before such consideration the individual has a real
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic capacity</span></em> to have these contradictory predicates affirmed
of him: they can be affirmed of him not merely when he is
regarded, and because he is regarded, under conceptually different
aspects, but because these principles, <span class="tei tei-q">“animality”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“rationality,”</span>
are already really in him not merely as aspects but as
distinct capacities, as potentially distinct principles of contradictory
predications.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The virtual distinction, understood in this way, is described
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em>. It is rejected by some on the ground that, at least
in its application to finite realities, it involves a violation of the
principle of contradiction: it seems to imply that one and the
same individual has in itself absolutely (and not merely as considered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under different aspects and relations) the capacity to
verify of itself contradictory predicates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Scotus and his followers go even farther than the advocates
of this intrinsic virtual distinction by maintaining the existence
of a distinction which on the one hand they hold to be less than
real because it is not between <span class="tei tei-q">“thing and thing,”</span> and on the
other hand to be more than logical or virtual, because it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em>
exists between the various thought-objects or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formalitates</span></span>”</span>
(such, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> as animality and rationality) in the individual, independently
of the analytic activity whereby the mind detects
these in the latter. This distinction Scotists call a <span class="tei tei-q">“formal
distinction, actual on the part of the thing”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">distinctio formalis</span></span>,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actualis ex natura rei</span></span>.”</span> Hence the name <span class="tei tei-q">“formalists”</span> applied
to Scotists, from their advocacy of this <span class="tei tei-q">“Scotistic”</span> distinction.
It is, they explain, a distinction not between <span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">res</span></span>”</span>)
but between <span class="tei tei-q">“formalities”</span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formalitates</span></span>”</span>). By <span class="tei tei-q">“thing”</span> as opposed
to <span class="tei tei-q">“formality”</span> they mean not merely the individual, but
also any positive thought-object which, though it may not be capable
of existing apart, can really appear in, or disappear from, a
thing which can so exist: for instance, the essential factors of
a really composite essence, its accidental modes, and its real
relations. By <span class="tei tei-q">“formality”</span> they mean a positive thought-object
which is absolutely inseparable from the thing in which it is
apprehended, which cannot exist without the thing, nor the
thing without it: for instance, all the metaphysical grades
of being in an individual, such as substantiality, corporeity,
life, animality, rationality, individuality, in an individual man.
The distinction is called <span class="tei tei-q">“formal”</span> because it is between such
<span class="tei tei-q">“formalities”</span>—each of which is the positive term of a separate
concept of the individual. It is called <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> on the side of
the thing”</span> because it is claimed to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em> in the latter apart
from our mental apprehension of the individual. What has
chiefly influenced Scotists in claiming this distinction to be thus
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em> in the individual, independently of our mental activity,
is the consideration that these metaphysical grades are grounds
on which we can predicate contradictory attributes of the same
individual, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> of an individual man that <span class="tei tei-q">“he is similar to a
horse”</span> and that <span class="tei tei-q">“he is not similar to a horse”</span>: whence they
infer that in order to avoid violation of the principle of contradiction,
we must suppose these grounds to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em> distinct
in the thing.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this it is replied, firstly, that if such predications were
truly contradictory we could avoid violation of the principle of
contradiction only by inferring a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> distinction—which Scotists
deny to exist—between these grounds; secondly, that such predications
are not truly contradictory inasmuch as <span class="tei tei-q">“he is similar”</span>
really means <span class="tei tei-q">“he is partially similar,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“he is not similar”</span>
means <span class="tei tei-q">“he is not completely similar”</span>; therefore when we
say that a man's rationality <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is not</span></em> the principle whereby he
resembles a horse,”</span> and his animality <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> the principle whereby
he resembles a horse,”</span> we mean (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) that his rationality is
not the principle of complete resemblance, though we know
it is the principle of partial resemblance, inasmuch as we see
it to be really identical with that which is the principle of
partial resemblance, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> his animality; and we mean (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) that his
animality is the principle of his partial resemblance to a horse,
not of total resemblance, for we know that the animality of a man
is not perfectly similar to that of a horse, the former being really
identical with rationality, the latter with irrationality. When,
then, we predicate of one thing that <span class="tei tei-q">“it is similar to some other
thing,”</span> and that <span class="tei tei-q">“it is not similar to this other thing”</span> we are not
really predicating contradictories of the same thing; if we take
the predicates as contradictories they are true of the same reality
undoubtedly, but not under the same aspect. Scotists themselves
admit that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real identity</span></em> of these aspects involves no violation
of the principle of contradiction; why, then, should these be held
to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em> distinct formalities independently of the consideration
of the mind? How can a distinction that is actual independently
of the mind's analysis of the reality be other than
real? Is not predication a work of the mind? And must not
the conditions on which reality verifies the predication be determined
by the mind? If, then, we see that in order to justify this
predication—of <span class="tei tei-q">“similar”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“not similar”</span>—about any reality,
it is merely necessary that the mind should apprehend this reality
to be in its undivided unity equivalent to manifold grades of being
or perfection which the mind itself can grasp as mentally distinct
aspects, by distinct concepts, how can we be justified in supposing
that these grades of being are not merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinguishable</span></em>,
but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually distinct</span></em> in the reality itself, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">independently of the mind</span></em>?

Scotists, by advocating an </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actual</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> distinction between these grades of

charge of extreme realism. They teach that each of these </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">formalities</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> has,
for abstract thought, a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">formal</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> unity which is </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">sui generis</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. And this unity is
not regarded as a product of thought, any more than the distinction between
such unities. Thus, the materiality apprehended by thought in all material
things is one, not because it is made one by the abstracting and universalizing
activity of thought, as most if not all other scholastics teach; it is
not merely </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">conceptually one</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> through our thought-activity, it is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">formally one</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
apart from the latter; and it thus knits into a </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">formal</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> unity all material

or metaphysical grade of being were regarded as a real unity, monism would
be of course the logically inevitable corollary of the theory.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
But the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">formal</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> unity of any such essential grade of being Scotists will

Thomists hold to be an abstraction, having no other unity than that which
thought confers upon it by making it logically universal, Scotists on the contrary
hold to be as such something positive in the ontological order, having
there a </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">formal</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> unity corresponding to the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">conceptual</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> or </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">logical</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> unity

40. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ontological Truth Considered from Analysis
of Experience.</span></span>—We have seen that when the mind thinks of
any reality it apprehends it as <span class="tei tei-q">“one,”</span> that ontological unity is a
transcendental attribute of being; and this consideration led us
to consider the manifoldness and the distinctions which characterize
the totality of our experience. Now man himself is a
real being surrounded by all the other real beings that constitute
the universe. Moreover he finds himself endowed with faculties
which bring him into conscious relations both with himself and
with those other beings; and only by the proper interpretation
of these relations can he understand aright his place in the universe.
The first in order of these relations is that of reality to
mind (<a href="#Section_25" class="tei tei-ref">25</a>). This relation between mind and reality is what we
understand by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Truth</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now truth is attributed both to knowledge and to things.
We say that a person thinks or judges <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truly</span></em>, that his knowledge
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em> (or correct, or accurate), when things really are as he thinks
or judges them to be. The truth which we thus ascribe to knowledge,
to the mind interpreting reality, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical</span></em> truth: a relation
of concord or conformity of the mind interpreting reality—or,
of the mind's judgment about reality—with the reality itself.<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a>
Logical truth is dealt with in Logic and Epistemology. We are
concerned here only with the truth that is attributed to reality,
to things themselves: ontological, metaphysical, transcendental
truth, as it is called. There is nothing abstruse or far-fetched
about the use of the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“true”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“truth”</span> as equivalent to
<span class="tei tei-q">“real”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“reality”</span>. We speak of <span class="tei tei-q">“true”</span> gold, a <span class="tei tei-q">“true”</span> friend,
a <span class="tei tei-q">“veritable”</span> hero, etc. Now what do we mean by thus ascribing
truth to a thing? We mean that it corresponds to a mental
type or ideal. We call a liquid true wine or real wine, for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
instance, when it verifies in itself the definition we have formed
of the nature of wine. Hence whenever we apply the terms
<span class="tei tei-q">“true”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“truth”</span> to a thing we shall find that we are considering
that thing not absolutely and in itself but in reference to an
idea in our minds: we do not say of a thing simply that it is
true, we say that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truly such or such</span></em> a thing, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> that it is
really of a certain nature already conceived by our minds. If the
appearance of the thing suggests comparison with some such
ideal type or nature, and if the thing is seen on examination not
really to verify this nature in itself, we say that it is not really or
truly such or such a thing: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> that a certain liquid is not really
wine, or is not true wine. When we have no such ideal type to
which to refer a thing, when we do not know its nature, cannot
classify and name it, we have to suspend our judgment and say
that we do not know what the thing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> is. Hence, for example,
the new rays discovered by Röntgen were called provisionally
<span class="tei tei-q">“X rays,”</span> their real nature being at first unknown. We
see, then, that real or ontological truth is simply reality considered
as conformable with an ideal type, with an idea in the
mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whence does the human mind derive these ideal types, these
concepts or definitions of the nature of things? It derives them
from actually experienced reality by abstraction, comparison,
generalization, and reflection on the data of its experience.<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a>
Hence it follows that the ontological truth of things is not
known by the mind antecedently to the formation of the mental
type. It is, of course, in the things antecedently to any judgment
we form about the things; and the logical truth of our judgments
is dependent on it, for logical truth is the conformity of our
judgments with the real nature of things. But antecedently to
all exercise of human thought, antecedently to our conception of
the nature of a thing, the thing has not for us <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em>
ontological truth: it has only fundamental or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potential</span></em> ontological
truth. If in this condition reality had actual ontological truth
for us, there would be no ground for our distinguishing mentally
between the reality and the truth of things; whereas the existence
of this mental or logical distinction is undeniable. The
concept of reality is the concept of something absolute; the
concept of ontological truth is the concept of something relative,
not of an absolute but of a relative property of being.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
But if for the human mind the ontological truth of things is—at least
proximately, immediately, and in the first place—their conformity with the
abstract concepts of essences or natures, concepts derived by the mind from
an analysis of its experience, how can this ontological truth be one for all men,
or immutable and necessary? For, since men form different and divergent
and conflicting conceptions as to the natures of things, and so have different
views and standards of truth for things, ontological truth would seem, according
to the exposition just outlined, to be not one but manifold, not immutable
but variable: consequences which surely cannot be admitted? The answer
to this difficulty will lead us to a deeper and more fundamental conception of
what ontological truth really is.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
First, then, we must consider that all men are endowed with the same
sort of intellect, an intellect capable of some insight at least into the nature of
things; that therefore they abstract the same transcendental notions and the
same widest concepts from their experience: transcendental concepts of being,
unity, truth, goodness; generic concepts of substance, matter, spirit, cause, of
accident, quantity, multitude, number, identity, similarity, distinction, diversity,
etc. They also form the same </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">specific</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> concepts of possible essences.
Although, therefore, they may disagree and err in regard to </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">the application</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
of those concepts, especially of the lower, richer and more complex specific
concepts, to the actual data of their experience, they agree in the fact that
they have those common concepts or idea-types of reality; also in the fact
that when they apply those concepts </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">rightly</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> (</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> by </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">logically true</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> judgments)
to the things that make up their experience, they have so far grasped the real
natures of these things; and finally in recognizing that the ontological truth
of these things lies in the conformity of the latter with their true and proper
mental types or essences. And just as each of these latter is one, indivisible,
immutable, necessary and eternal (</span><a href="#Section_14" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">14</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Section_15" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">15</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">), so is the ontological truth of things,
whether possible or actual, one, indivisible, immutable, necessary and eternal.
Of course, just as the human mind does not constitute but only apprehends
reality, so the human mind does not constitute the ontological truth of
reality, but only apprehends it. Every reality is capable of producing in the
human mind a more or less adequate mental representation of itself: in this
lies what we may call the potential or fundamental ontological truth of
reality. When it does produce such a mental concept of itself its relation of
conformity to this concept is its formal ontological truth. Of course the
human mind may err in applying to any reality a wrong concept; when it
does it has so far failed to grasp the real nature of the thing and therefore
the ontological truth which is really identical with this nature. But the
thing still has its ontological truth, independently of the erring mind; not
only fundamental truth, but also possibly formal truth in so far as it may be
rightly apprehended, and thus related to its proper mental type, by other
human minds. Reality itself, therefore, is not and cannot be false, as we
shall see more fully later; error or falsity is an accident only of the mind
interpreting reality.

41. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ontological Truth Considered Synthetically,
from the Standpoint of its Ultimate Real Basis.</span></span>—So far
we have explained ontological truth as a relation of reality to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
human intelligence; but this relation is not one of dependence.
The objective term of the relation, the reality itself, is anterior to
the human mind, it is not constituted by the latter. The subjective
term, the abstract concept, is indeed as a vital product
dependent on the mind, but as representative of reality it is
determined only by the latter. Is there, however, an Intelligence
to which reality is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essentially</span></em> conformed, other than the human
intelligence? Granted the actual existence of contingent realities,
and granted that the human mind can derive from these realities
rational principles which it sees to be necessarily and universally
applicable to all the data of experience, we can demonstrate the
existence of a Necessary Being, a First and Self-Existent Intelligence.
Realizing, then, that God has created all things according
to Infinite Wisdom, we can see that the essences of things are
imitations of exemplar ideas in the Divine Mind (<a href="#Section_20" class="tei tei-ref">20</a>). On the
Divine Mind they depend essentially for their reality and intelligibility.
It is because all created realities, including the human
mind itself, are adumbrations of the Divine Essence, that they are
intelligible to the human mind. Thus we see that in the ontological
order, in the order of real gradation and dependence
among things, as distinct from the order of human experience,<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a>
the reason why reality has ontological truth for the human mind
is because it is antecedently and essentially in accord with the
Divine Mind from which it derives its intelligibility. Although,
therefore, ontological truth is for us proximately and immediately
the conformity of reality with our own conceptions, it is primarily
and fundamentally the essential conformity of all reality with the
Divine Mind. All reality, actual and possible, including the
Divine Essence itself, is actually comprehended by the Divine
Mind, is actually in conformity with the exemplar ideas in the
Divine Mind, and has therefore ontological truth even independently
of its relation to created minds; but <span class="tei tei-q">“in the (impossible)
hypothesis of the absence of all intellect, such a thing as truth
would be inconceivable”</span>.<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reason, therefore, why things are ontologically true for
our minds, why our minds can apprehend their essences, why we
can have any true knowledge about them, is in fact because both
our minds and all things else, being expressions of the Divine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Essence, are in essential conformity with the Divine Intellect.
Not that we must know all this in order to have any logical
truth, any true knowledge, about things; or in order to ascribe
to things the ontological truth which consists in their conformity
with our conception of their nature. The atheist can have a true
knowledge of things and can recognize in them their conformity
with his mental conception of their nature; only he is unaware
of the real and fundamental reason why he can do so. Nor can
he, of course, while denying the existence of God, rise to the
fuller conception of ontological truth which consists in the
essential conformity of all reality with the Divine Intellect, and
its essential dependence on the latter for its intelligibility to the
human intellect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Naturally, it is this latter and fuller conception of ontological
truth that has been at all times expounded by scholastic philosophers.<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a>

Logical truth is manifold—multiplied

possible, is eternal, but that no other truth is eternal. There is no eternal
truth outside of God. Created things are not eternal; and truth is consecutive
on reality: where there is no reality there is no ontological truth: the
conformity of things with human conceptions and the logical truth of the
latter are both alike temporal.</span><a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a>

and so is the essential conformity of all reality with the Divine Intellect. The
change to which created reality is essentially subject is itself essentially conformed
with the Divine Mind; it is, so to speak, part and parcel of the ontological
truth of this reality in relation to the Divine Mind, and cannot therefore
interfere with this ontological truth. When the acorn grows into the
oak the whole process has its ontological truth; that of the acorn changes,
not into falsity, but into another truth, that of the oak.</span><a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> We see, then, that
as things change, their truth does not change in the sense of being lost or
giving place to falsity: the truth of one state changes to the truth of another
while the ontological truth of the changing reality perseveres immutably.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">

42. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ontological Truth a Transcendental Attribute
of Reality.</span></span>—From what has been said it will be apparent that
ontological truth is a transcendental attribute of reality. That
is to say, whatever is real, whether actual or possible, is ontologically
true; or, in scholastic terminology, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Omne ens est verum;
Ens et verum convertuntur</span></span>: All being is true; The real and the
true are convertible terms”</span>. For in the first place there is no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mode or category of real being, of which the human mind actually
thinks, to which it does not attribute ontological truth in the
sense of conformity with the right human conception of it.
Moreover, the proper object of the human intellect is reality; all
true knowledge is knowledge of reality. Reality of itself is
manifestly knowable, intelligible, and thus potentially or fundamentally
true; and, on the other hand, intellect is, according to
the measure of its capacity, a faculty of insight into all reality,
into whatever is real: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">intellectus potens fieri omnia; anima ... quodammodo
fit omnia</span></span>.<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a> Deny either of these postulates regarding
the terms of the ontological relation, reality and mind, and
all rational thought is instantly paralysed. Hence, in so far as
a reality becomes an actual object of human knowledge it has
formal ontological truth in relation both to the human mind and
to the Divine Mind; while antecedently to human thought it is
fundamentally true, or intelligible, to the human mind, and of
course formally true in relation to the Divine Mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we see that whatever is real is ontologically true; that
ontological truth is really identical with real being; that, applied
to the latter, it is not a mere extrinsic denomination, but signifies
an intrinsic, positive aspect of reality, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the real, essential, or
transcendental relation of all real being to Mind or Intellect: a
relation which is logically or conceptually distinct from the notion
of reality considered in itself.

43. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Attribution of Falsity to Real Being.</span></span>—If ontological
truth is really identical with real being, if it is an essential
aspect of the latter, a transcendental relation of reality to mind,
it follows immediately that there can be no such thing as transcendental
falsity: if whatever is real is ontologically true, then
the ontologically false must be the unreal, must be nothingness.
And this is really so: ontologically falsity <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> nothingness. We
have, therefore, to discover the real meaning of attributing falsity
to things, as when we speak of a false friend, false gold, false
teeth, a false musical note, a false measure in poetry, etc.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First of all, then, it will be noted that each such object has
its own real nature and character, its proper mental correlate,
and, therefore, its ontological truth. The false friend is a true or
real deceiver, or traitor, or coward, or whatever his real character
may be; the false gold is true or real bronze, or alloy, or whatever
it may be in reality; the false teeth are true or real ivory,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or whatever substance they are made of; a false musical note is
a true or real note but not the proper one in its actual setting;
and so of a false measure in poetry. Next, when we thus ascribe
falsity to a friend, or gold, or such like, we see that the epithet
<span class="tei tei-q">“false”</span> is in reality merely transferred from the false judgment
which a person is liable to make about the object. We mean
that to judge that person a friend, or that substance gold, or those
articles real teeth, would be to form a false judgment. We see
that it is only in the judgment there can be falsity; but we
transfer the epithet to the object because the object is likely to occasion
the erroneous judgment in the fallible human mind, by reason
of the resemblance of the object to something else which it really is
not. We see, therefore, that falsity is not in the objects, but is transferred
to them by a purely extrinsic denomination on account of
appearances calculated to mislead. We commonly say, in such
cases that <span class="tei tei-q">“things mislead us,”</span> that <span class="tei tei-q">“appearances deceive us”</span>.
Things, however, do not deceive or mislead us <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em>, but
only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidentally</span></em>: they are the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">occasions</span></em> of our allowing ourselves
to be deceived: the fallibility and limitations of our own minds
in interpreting reality are the real cause of our erroneous judgments.<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, there is another improper sense in which we attribute
falsity to works of art which fail to realize the artist's ideal.
In this sense we speak of a <span class="tei tei-q">“false”</span> note in music, a <span class="tei tei-q">“false”</span>
measure in poetry, a <span class="tei tei-q">“false”</span> tint in painting, a <span class="tei tei-q">“false”</span> curve in
sculpture or architecture. <span class="tei tei-q">“False”</span> here means defective, bad,
wanting in perfection. The object being out of harmony with
the ideal or design in the practical intellect of the artist, we describe
it as <span class="tei tei-q">“false”</span> after the analogy of what takes place when
we describe as <span class="tei tei-q">“false gold”</span> a substance which is out of harmony
with the idea of gold in the speculative intellect. It is in relation
to the speculative, not the practical, intellect, that things
have ontological truth. All created things are, of course, as such,
in conformity not only with the Divine Intellect considered as
speculative, but also with the Divine Intellect considered as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
practical. For God, being omnipotent, does all things according
to the designs of His Wisdom. For Him nothing is accidental,
nothing happens by chance. But the world He has freely willed
to create is not the best possible world. Both in the physical
and in the moral order there are things and events which are
defective, which fall short of their natural perfection. This defectiveness,
which is properly physical or moral evil, is sometimes
described as falsity, lying, vanity, etc., on account of the discrepancy
between those things and the ideal of what they should
be. But all such defective realities are known to be what they
are by the Divine Mind, and may be known as they really are by
the human mind. They have, therefore, their ontological truth.
The question of their perfection or imperfection gives rise to the
consideration of quite a different aspect of reality, namely its
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">goodness</span></em>. This, then, we must deal with in the next place.

most familiar of all notions. But like all other transcendental
or widely generic concepts, the analysis of it opens up some
fundamental questions. The princes of ancient Greek philosophy,
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, gave much anxious thought to its
elucidation. The tentative gropings of Socrates involved an
ambiguity which issued in the conflicting philosophies of Stoicism
and Epicureanism. Nor did Plato succeed in bringing down
from the clouds the <span class="tei tei-q">“Idea of the Good”</span> which he so devotedly
worshipped as the Sun of the Intellectual World. It needed
the more sober and searching analysis of the Stagyrite to bring
to light the formula so universally accepted in after ages: The
Good of beings is that which all desire: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Bonum est quod omnia
appetunt</span></span>.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a> Let us try to reach the fundamental idea underlying
the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“good,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“goodness,”</span> by some simple examples.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The child, deriving sensible pleasure from a sweetmeat, cries
out: That is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>! Whatever gratifies its senses, gives it
sensible delight, it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">likes</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">loves</span></em>. Such things it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desires</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seeks</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yearns for</span></em>, in their absence; and in their presence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">enjoys</span></em>. At
this stage the good means simply the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pleasure-giving</span></em>. But as
reason develops the human being apprehends and describes as
good not merely what is pleasure-giving, but whatever satisfies
any natural need or craving, whether purely organic, or purely
intellectual, or more widely human: food is good because it
satisfies a physical, organic craving; knowledge is good because
it satisfies a natural intellectual thirst; friendship is good because
it satisfies a wider need of the heart. Here we notice a transition
from <span class="tei tei-q">“agreeable”</span> in the sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“pleasure-giving”</span> to <span class="tei tei-q">“agreeable”</span>
in the more proper sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“suitable”</span> or useful. The
good is now conceived not in the narrow sense of what yields
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sensible pleasure but in the wider sense of that which is useful or
suitable for the satisfaction of a natural tendency or need, that
which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the object of a natural tendency</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next, let us reflect, with Aristotle, that each of the individual
persons and things that make up the world of our direct experience
has an end towards which it naturally tends. There is
a purpose in the existence of each. Each has a nature, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> an
essence which is for it a principle of development, a source of all
the functions and activities whereby it continually adapts itself
to its environment and thereby continually fulfils the aim of its
existence. By its very nature it tends towards its end along the
proper line of its development.<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a> In the world of conscious
beings this natural tendency is properly called appetite: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sense
appetite</span></em> of what is apprehended as good by sense cognition, and
rational appetite or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> in regard to what is apprehended as
good by intellect or reason. In the world of unconscious things
this natural tendency is a real tendency and is analogous to
conscious appetite. Hence it is that Aristotle, taking in all
grades of real being, describes the good as that which is the
object of any natural tendency or <span class="tei tei-q">“appetite”</span> whatsoever: the
good is the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appetibile</span></em>”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“desirable,”</span> that which all things
seek: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum est quod omnia appetunt</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

45. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Good as an </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">“</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">End,</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">”</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">“</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Perfecting</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">”</span></span><span style="font-variant: small-caps"> the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">“</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Nature</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">”</span></span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">.</span></span>—So
far, we have analysed the notion of what is <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for
some being</span></em>; and we have gathered that it implies what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suits</span></em> this
being, what contributes to the latter's realization of its end. But
we apply the term <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> to objects, and speak of their goodness,
apart from their direct and immediate relation of helpfulness
or suitability <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for us</span></em>. When, for instance, we say of a watch that
it is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> one, or of a soldier that he is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> soldier, what
precisely do we mean by such attribution of goodness to things
or persons? A little reflection will show that it is intelligible
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only in reference to an end or purpose</span></em>. And we mean by it that
the being we describe as good has the powers, qualities, equipments,
which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fit it for its end or purpose</span></em>. A being is good whose
nature is equipped and adapted for the realization of its natural
end or purpose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we see that the notion of goodness is correlative with
the notion of an end, towards which, or for which, a being has a
natural tendency or desire. Without the concept of a nature as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tending to realize an end or purpose, the notion of <span class="tei tei-q">“the good”</span>
would be inexplicable.<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a> And the two formulæ, <span class="tei tei-q">“The good is
that which beings desire, or towards which they naturally tend,”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“The good is that which is adapted to the ends which beings
have in their existence,”</span> really come to the same thing; the
former statement resolving itself into the latter as the more
fundamental. For the reason why anything is desirable, why it
is the object of a natural tendency, is because it is good, and not
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>. The description of the good as that which is desirable,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Bonum est id quod est appetibile</span></span>,”</span> is an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> description,
a description of cause by reference to effect.<a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a> A thing is
desirable because it is good. Why then is it good, and therefore
desirable? Because it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suits</span></em> the natural needs, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is adapted</span></em> to
the nature, of the being that desires it or tends towards it;
because it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">helps</span></em> this being, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agrees with</span></em> it, by contributing towards
the realization of its end: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Bonum est id quod convenit naturæ
appetentis</span></span>: The good is that which suits the nature of the being
that desires it. The greatest good for a being is the realization
of its end; and the means towards this are also good because
they contribute to this realization.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No doubt, in beings endowed with consciousness the gradual
realization of this natural tendency, by the normal functioning
and development of their activities, is accompanied by pleasurable
feeling. The latter is, in fact, not an end of action itself, but
rather the natural concomitant, the effect and index, of the
healthy and normal activity of the conscious being: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio
sequitur operationem debitam</span></span>. It is the pleasure felt in tending
towards the good that reveals the good to the conscious agent:
that is, taking pleasure in its wide sense as the feeling of well-being,
of satisfaction with one's whole condition, activities and
environment. Hence it is the anticipated pleasure, connected
by past association with a certain line of action, that stimulates
the conscious being to act in that way again. It is in the first
instance because a certain operation or tendency is felt to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pleasing</span></em> that it is desired, and apprehended as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desirable</span></em>. Nor
does the brute beast recognize or respond to any stimulus of
action other than pleasure. But man—endowed with reason, and
reflecting on the relation between his own nature and the
activities whereby he duly orients his life in his environment—must
see that what is pleasure-giving or <span class="tei tei-q">“agreeable”</span> in the
ordinary sense of this term is generally so because it is <span class="tei tei-q">“agreeable”</span>
in the deeper sense of being <span class="tei tei-q">“suitable to his nature,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“adapted to his end,”</span> and therefore <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The good, then, is whatever suits the nature of a being tending
towards its end: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum est conveniens naturæ appetentis</span></span>. In what
precisely does this suitability consist? What suits any nature
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfects</span></em> that nature, and suits it precisely in so far as it perfects it.
But whatever perfects a nature does so only because and in so far
as it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a realization of the end</span></em> towards which this nature tends.
Here we reach a new notion, that of <span class="tei tei-q">“perfecting”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“perfection,”</span>
and one which is as essentially connected with the notion of
<span class="tei tei-q">“end”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“purpose,”</span> as the concept of the <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> itself is.
Let us compare these notions of <span class="tei tei-q">“goodness,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“end,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“perfection”</span>.
We have said that a watch or a soldier are good when
they are adapted to their respective ends. But they are so only
because the end itself is already good. And we may ask why
any such end is itself good and therefore desirable. For example,
why is the accurate indication of time good, or the defence of
one's country? And obviously in such a series of questions we
must come to something which is good and desirable in and for
itself, for its own sake and not as leading and helping towards
some remoter good. And this something which is good in and
for itself is a last or ultimate end—an absolute, not a relative,
good. There must be such an absolute good, such an ultimate
end, if goodness in things is to be made intelligible at all. And
it is only in so far as things tend towards this absolute good, and
are adapted to it, that they can be termed good. The realization
of this tendency of things towards the absolute good, or
ultimate end, is what constitutes the goodness of those things,
and it does so because it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfects their natures</span></em>.

recognize in the goodness of finite, created things, is explained in the philosophy
of theism as being derived, with this goodness itself, from the uncreated
goodness of God who is the Ultimate End and Supreme Good of all reality.
Every creature has its own proper ultimate end and highest perfection in its
being a manifestation, an expression, a shewing forth, of the Divine Goodness.
It has its own actuality and goodness, distinct from, but dependent on, the
Divine Goodness; but inasmuch as its goodness is an expression or imitation
of the Divine Goodness, we may, by an </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> denomination, say that the

46. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Perfect. Analysis of the Notion of Perfection.</span></span>—It
is the realization of the end or object or purpose of a
nature that perfects the latter, and so far formally constitutes the
goodness of this nature. Now the notion of perfection is not
exactly the same as the notion of goodness: although what is
perfect is always good, what is good is not always perfect. The
term <span class="tei tei-q">“perfect”</span> comes from the Latin <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">perficere</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">perfectum</span></span>, meaning
fully made, thoroughly achieved, completed, finished. Strictly
speaking, it is only finite being, potential being, capable of completion,
that can be spoken of as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfectible</span></em>, or, when fully actualized,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect</span></em>. But by universal usage the term has been extended
to the reality of the Infinite Being: we speak of the latter as the
Infinitely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Perfect</span></em> Being, not meaning that this Being has been
<span class="tei tei-q">“perfected,”</span> but that He is the purely Actual and Infinite Reality.
Applied to any finite being, the term <span class="tei tei-q">“perfect”</span> means that this
being has attained to the full actuality which we regard as its
end, as the ideal of its natural capacity and tendency. The
finite being is subject to change; it is not actualized all at once,
but gradually; by the play of those active and passive powers
which are rooted in its nature it is gradually actualized, and thus
perfected, gaining more and more reality or being by the process.
But what directs this process and determines the line of its tendency?
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> which is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> of the being, the good towards
which the being by its nature tends. This good, which is the
term of the being's natural tendency—which is, in other words, its
end—is the fundamental principle<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> which perfects the nature of
the being, is the source and explanation of the process whereby
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this nature is perfected: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum est perfectivum</span></span>: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the good is the
perfecting principle of reality</span></em>. The end itself is <span class="tei tei-q">“the good which
perfects,”</span> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum quod</span></span>; the <span class="tei tei-q">“perfecting”</span> itself is the formal
cause of the goodness of the being that is perfected, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum quo</span></span>;
the being itself which is perfected, and therefore ameliorated or
increased in goodness, is the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum cui</span></span>. In proportion, therefore,
to the degree in which a being actually possesses the perfection
due to its nature it is <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span>; in so far as it lacks this
perfection, it is wanting in goodness, or is, as we shall see, ontologically
<span class="tei tei-q">“bad”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“evil”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While, then, the notion of the <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> implies a relation of
the appetite or natural tendency of a being towards its end, the
notion of <span class="tei tei-q">“perfection,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“perfecting,”</span> conveys to our minds
actual reality simply, or the actualizing of reality. The term
<span class="tei tei-q">“perfection”</span> is commonly used as synonymous with actual
reality. In so far forth as a reality is actual we say it <span class="tei tei-q">“has perfection”</span>.
But we do not call it <span class="tei tei-q">“perfect”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simply</span></em>, unless it has
all the actuality we conceive to be due to its nature: so long as
it lacks any of this it is only perfect <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">secundum quid</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> in proportion
to the actuality it does possess. Hence we define <span class="tei tei-q">“the
perfect”</span> as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that which is actually lacking in nothing that is due to
its nature</span></em>. The perfect is therefore not simply the good, but the
complete or finished good; and it is even logically distinct from
the latter, inasmuch as the actuality connoted by the former
has added to it the relation to appetite connoted by the latter.
Similarly <span class="tei tei-q">“goodness”</span> is logically distinct from <span class="tei tei-q">“perfection”</span>
by adding the like relation to the latter. Although a thing has
goodness in so far as it has perfection, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>, still its perfection
is its actuality simply, while its goodness is this actuality
considered as the term of its natural appetite or tendency.

Value.</span></span>—We may distinguish between stages of perfection in
the changing reality of the same being, or grades of perfection in
comparing with one another different classes or orders of being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In one and the same being we may distinguish between what
is called its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> perfection, which means its essence
or nature considered as capable of realizing its purpose in existence
by tending effectively towards its end; what is called its
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intermediate</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em> perfection, which consists in all the
powers, faculties and functions whereby this tendency is gradually
actualized; and what is called its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">integral</span></em> perfection,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which consists in its full actualization by complete attainment of
its end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, comparing with one another the individual beings
that make up our experience, we classify them, we arrange them
in a hierarchical order of relative <span class="tei tei-q">“perfection,”</span> of inferiority or
superiority, according to the different grades of reality or perfection
which we think we apprehend in them. Thus, we look on
living things as a higher, nobler, more perfect order of beings
than non-living things, on animal life as a higher form of being
than plant life, on intelligence as higher than instinct, on will as
superior to sense appetite, on mind or spirit as nobler than
matter, and so on. Now all such comparisons involve the
apprehension of some standard of value. An estimation of
relative values, or relative grades of perfection in things, is unintelligible
except in reference to some such standard; it involves
of necessity the intuition of such a standard. We feel
sure that some at least of our appreciations are unquestionably
correct: that man, for instance, is superior to the brute beast,
and the latter superior to the plant; that the lowest manifestation
of life—in the amœba, or whatever monocellular, microscopic
germ may be the lowest—is higher on the scale of being than
the highest expression of the mechanical, chemical and physical
forces of the inorganic universe. And if we ask ourselves what
is our standard of comparison, what is our test or measure, and
why are we sure of our application of it in such cases, our only
answer is that our standard of comparison is reality itself, actual
being, perfection; that we rely implicitly on our intuition of such
actual reality as manifested to us in varying grades or degrees
within our experience; that without claiming to be infallible in
our judgments of comparison, in our classifications of things, in
our appreciations of their relative perfection, we may justly
assume reality itself to be as such intelligible, and the human mind
to be capable of obtaining some true and certain insight into the
nature of reality.

48. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Good, the Real, and the Actual.</span></span>—Having
compared <span class="tei tei-q">“perfection”</span> with <span class="tei tei-q">“goodness”</span> and with <span class="tei tei-q">“being,”</span> let
us next compare the two latter notions with each other. We
shall see presently that every actual being has its ontological
goodness, that these are in reality identical. But there is a
logical distinction between them. In the first place the term
<span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> is applied <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par excellence</span></span> to substances rather than to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accidents. But we do not commonly speak of an individual
substance, a person or thing, as good in reference to essential or
substantial perfection.<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> When we describe a man, or a machine,
as <span class="tei tei-q">“good,”</span> we mean that the man possesses those <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em>
perfections, those qualities and endowments, which are suitable
to his nature as a man; that the machine possesses those properties
which adapt it to its end. In the second place the notion
of being is absolute; that of the good is relative, for it implies
the notion not of reality simply but of reality as desirable,
agreeable, suitable, as perfecting the nature of a subject, as being
the end, or conducive to the end, towards which this nature
tends. And since what thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfects</span></em> must be something not
potential but actual, it follows that, unlike real truth, real goodness
is identical not with potential, but only with actual reality.
It is not an attribute of the abstract, possible essence, but only
of the concrete, actually existing essence.<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the fact that the notion of the good is relative it
follows that the same thing can be simultaneously good and bad
in different relations: <span class="tei tei-q">“What is one man's meat is another man's
poison”</span>.

49. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Kinds of Goodness; Divisions of the Good.</span></span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>)
The goodness of a being may be considered in relation to this
being itself, or to other beings. What is good for a being itself,
what makes it intrinsically and formally good, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum sibi</span></span>, is
whatever perfects it, and in the fullest sense the realization of
its end. Hence we speak of a virtuous, upright man, whose
conduct is in keeping with his nature and conducive to the
realization of his end, as a good man. But a being may also be
good to others, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum alteri</span></span>, by an extrinsic, active, effective
goodness, inasmuch as by its action it may help other beings
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the realization of their ends. In this sense, a beneficent man,
who wishes the well-being of his fellow-men and helps them to
realize this well-being, is called a good man. This kind of
goodness is what is often nowadays styled <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philanthropy</span></em>; in
Christian ethics it is known as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">charity</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) We have described the good as the term or object of
natural tendency or appetite. In the domain of beings not
endowed with the power of conscious apprehension, determinism
rules this natural tendency; this latter is always oriented towards
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> good: it never acts amiss: it is always directed by the
Divine Wisdom which has given to things their natures. But in
the domain of conscious living agents this natural tendency is
consequent on apprehension: it takes the form of instinctive
animal appetite or of rational volition. And since this apprehension
of the good may be erroneous, since what is not really good
but evil may be apprehended as good, the appetite or will, which
follows this apprehension—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nil volitum nisi praecognitum</span></span>—may
be borne towards evil <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sub ratione boni</span></span>. Hence the obvious distinction
between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real good</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apparent good</span></em>—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum verum</span></span> and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum apparens</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) In reference to any individual subject—a man, for instance—it
is manifest that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em> beings can be good for him in so far
as any of them can be his end or a means to the attainment of
his end. They are called in reference to him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective goods</span></em>, and
their goodness <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective goodness</span></em>. But it is equally clear that
they are good for him only because he can perfect his own
nature by somehow identifying or uniting himself with them,
possessing, using, or enjoying them. This possession of the
objective good constitutes what has been already referred to as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective goodness</span></em>.<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) We have likewise already referred to the fact that in
beings endowed with consciousness and appetite proper, whether
sentient or rational, the function of possessing or attaining to
what is objectively good, to what suits and perfects the nature of
the subject, has for its natural concomitant a feeling of pleasure,
satisfaction, well-being, delight, enjoyment. And we have
observed that this pleasurable feeling may then become a
stimulus to fresh desire, may indeed be desired for its own sake.
Now this subjective, pleasure-giving possession of an objective
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
good has been itself called by scholastics <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum delectabile</span></span>—delectable
or delight-giving good. The objective good itself
considered as an end, and the perfecting of the subject by its
attainment, have been called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum honestum</span></span>—good which is
really and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em> such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in itself</span></em>. While if the good in question
is really such only when considered as a means to the attainment
of an end, of something that is good in itself, the former is
called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum utile</span></span>—useful good.<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this important triple division <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum honestum</span></span> is used in
the wide sense in which it embraces any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> good, whether
physical or moral. As applied to man it would therefore
embrace whatever perfects his physical life as well as whatever
perfects his nature considered as a rational, and therefore moral,
being. But in common usage it has been restricted to the latter,
and is in this sense synonymous with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral good</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">virtue</span></em>.<a id="noteref_182" name="noteref_182" href="#note_182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Furthermore, a good which is an end, and therefore desirable
for its own sake, whether it be physical or moral, can be at the
same time a means to some higher good and desired for the sake
of this latter. Hence St. Thomas, following Aristotle, reduces
all the moral goods which are desirable in themselves to two
kinds: that which is desirable only for itself, which is the last
end, final felicity; and those which, while good in themselves,
are also conducive to the former, and these are the virtues.<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href="#note_183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a>

When these various kinds of goodness are examined in reference to the
nature, conduct and destiny of man, they raise a multitude of problems which
belong properly to Ethics and Natural Theology. The fact that man has a
composite nature which is the seat of various and conflicting tendencies, of
the flesh and of the spirit; that he perceives in himself a </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">double law,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> a
higher and a lower appetite; that he is subject to error in his apprehension
of the good; that he apprehends a distinction between pleasure and duty;
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
that he feels the latter to be the path to ultimate happiness,—all this accentuates
the distinction between real and apparent good, between </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">bonum honestum</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,

The existence of God is established in
Natural Theology; and in Ethics, aided by Psychology, it is proved that no
finite good can be the last end of man, that God, the Supreme, Infinite
Good, is his last end, and that only in the possession of God by knowledge
and love can man find his complete and final felicity.

50. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Goodness a Transcendental Attribute of Being.</span></span>—We
have shown that there is a logical distinction between the
concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“goodness”</span> and that of <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span>. We have now to
show that the distinction is not real, in other words, that goodness
is a transcendental attribute of all actual reality, that all being, in
so far forth as it is actual, has goodness—transcendental or ontological
goodness in the sense of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appetibility</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desirability</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suitability</span></em>,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the thesis is formulated in the traditional scholastic
statement, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Omne ens est bonum</span></em>: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">All being is good</span></em>”</span> it sounds a
startling paradox. Surely it cannot be contended that everything
is good? A cancer in the stomach is not good; lies are not
good; yet these are actual realities; cancers exist and lies are
told; therefore not every reality is good. This is unquestionably
true. But it does not contradict the thesis rightly understood.
The true meaning of the thesis is, not that every being is good
in all respects, or possesses such goodness as would justify us in
describing it as <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> in the ordinary sense, but that every
being possesses some goodness: every being in so far as it has
actuality has formal, intrinsic goodness, or is, in other words, the
term or object of natural tendency or desire. This goodness,
which we predicate of any and every actual being, may be (1) the
term of the natural tendency or appetite of that being itself,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum sibi</span></span>, or (2) it may be conceivably the term of the appetite
of some other being, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum alteri</span></span>. Let us see whether it can be
shown that every actual being has goodness in one or both of
these senses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Bonum sibi</span></span>.—Is there any intelligible sense in which it
can be said that the actuality of any and every existing being is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good for that being</span></em>—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum sibi</span></span>? There is. For if we recognize
in every such being, as we must, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>, a potentiality of
further actualization, a tendency towards a state of fuller actuality
which is its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em>; and if, furthermore, we recognize that every
such being at any instant not merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> or exists, but is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">becoming</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">changing</span></em>, and thereby tending effectively towards its end; we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must admit not merely that the full attainment of its end (its
integral or final perfection) is <span class="tei tei-q">“desired”</span> by, and <span class="tei tei-q">“perfects,”</span> and is
<span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> for, that being's nature; but also that the partial realization
of its end, or, in other words, the actuality it has at any instant
in its changing condition of existence (its accidental or intermediate
perfection) is similarly <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> for it; and even that its
actual existence as compared with its mere possibility (its first
or essential perfection) is <span class="tei tei-q">“desirable”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> for its nature.
Actually existing beings are intelligible only because they exist
for some end or purpose, which, by their very existence, activities,
operations, conduct, they tend to realize. If this be admitted we
cannot deny that the full attainment of this end or purpose is
<span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> for them—suitable, desirable, agreeable, perfecting them.
In so far as they fail in this purpose they are wanting in goodness,
they are bad, evil. For the realization of their end their
natures are endowed with appropriate powers, faculties, forces,
by the normal functioning of which they gradually develop and
grow in actuality. No real being is by nature inert or aimless;
no real being is without its connatural faculties, forces and functions.
But the natural result of all operation, of all action and
interaction among things, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actualization</span></em> of the potential,
amelioration, development, growth in perfection and goodness by
gradual realization of ends. If by accident any of these powers
is wanting, or acts amiss by failing to contribute its due perfection
to the nature, there is in the being a proportionate want of
goodness—it is so far bad, evil. But, even so, the nature of the
thing preserves its fundamental orientation towards its end, towards
the perfection natural to it, and struggles as it were against
the evil—tries to make good the deficiency. A cancer in the
stomach is never good <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the stomach</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the living subject</span></em> of
which the stomach is an organ. For the living being the cancer
is an evil, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">failure</span></em> of one of the organs to discharge its functions
normally, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an absence of a good</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the healthy functioning of an
organ. But the cancerous growth, considered in itself and for
itself, biologically and chemically, has its own nature, purpose,
tendencies, laws; nor can we deny that its development according
to these laws is <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> for its specific nature,<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href="#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum sibi</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be asked how can the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> perfection of an
existing substance, which is nothing else than the actual existence
of the nature itself, be conceived as <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> for this nature? It
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is so inasmuch as the actual existence of the substance is the
first stage in the process by which the nature tends towards its
end; an existing nature desires and tends towards the conservation
of its own being;<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href="#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a> hence the saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Self-preservation is

<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Melius est esse quam non esse</span></span>”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The argument just outlined tends to show that every nature
of which we can have direct experience, or in other words every
finite, contingent nature, is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum sibi</span></span>, formally and intrinsically
good for itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is, of course, equally applicable to the Uncreated, Necessary
Being Himself. The Infinite Actuality of the Divine Nature is
essentially the term and end of the Divine Love. Therefore
every actual being has intrinsic, formal goodness, whereby it is

object of tendency, desire, appetite, a something that really suits
and perfects this nature. Thus understood, the thesis formulates
no mere tautology. It makes a real assertion about real being;
nor can the truth of this assertion be proved otherwise than by
an argument based, as ours is, on the recognition of purpose, of
final causality, of adaptation of means to ends, in the actual
universe of our experience.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Notwithstanding all that has been said, it may still be asked
why should those individual beings, whose existence we have
claimed to be good for them, exist at all. It will be objected
that there exist multitudes of beings whose existence is manifestly
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> good for them. Take, for instance, the case of the
reprobate. If they wish their total annihilation, if they desire
the total cessation of their being, rather than an existence of
eternal punishment, they undoubtedly wish it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a good</span></em>. Is
annihilation or absolute non-existence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> a good <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for them</span></em>?
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">De facto</span></span> it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for them</span></em>, considered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in their actual condition</span></em> which
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental to their nature</span></em>. Christ said of the scandal-giver
what is surely true of the reprobate: <span class="tei tei-q">“It were better for that
man had he never been born”</span>. We may admit, therefore, that
for the reprobate themselves simple non-existence is more
desirable, and better, than their actual concrete state of existence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as reprobate: because simple non-existence is for them
the simple <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">negation</span></em> of their reality, whereas the absolute and
irreparable loss of their last end, the total frustration of the purpose
for which they came into being, is for them the greatest
conceivable <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">privation</span></em>. But this condition of the reprobate is
accidental to their nature, alien to the purpose of their being, a
self-incurred failure, a deliberate thwarting of their natural
tendency. It remains true, therefore, that their nature is good
though incapable of progress, its purpose is good though frustrated.
In so far as they have actual reality they have
<span class="tei tei-q">“essential”</span> goodness. Their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natures</span></em> still tend towards self-conservation
and the realization of their end. They form no
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> exception to the general truth that <span class="tei tei-q">“it is better to be than
not to be: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">melius est esse quam non esse</span></span>”</span>. It is not annihilation
as such that is desired by them, but only as a less evil
alternative than the eternal privation of their last end.<a id="noteref_186" name="noteref_186" href="#note_186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a> If the
evils accidentally and actually attaching to a certain state of

in existence, simply and in itself, is less desirable than non-existence.

tends to its own good as a particular end, also teaches us that
in the general scheme of reality things are helpful to one another,
nay, are intended by their interaction and co-operation with one
another to subserve the wider end which is the good of the whole
system of reality. There is little use in puzzling, as people
sometimes do, over the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'être</span></span> of individual things or
classes of things in human experience, over the good or the evil
of the existence of these things, over the question whether or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not it would be better that these things should never have
existed, until we have consulted not any isolated portion of
human experience but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this experience as a whole</span></em>. In this we
can find sufficient evidence for the prevalence of a beneficent
purpose everywhere. Not that we can read this purpose in
every detail of reality. Even when we have convinced ourselves
that all creation is the work of a Supreme Being who is Infinite
Goodness Itself, we cannot gain that full insight into the secret
designs of His Providence, which would be needed in order to
<span class="tei tei-q">“justify His ways”</span> in all things. But when we have convinced
ourselves that the created universe exists because God wills it,
we can understand that every actual reality in it must be
<span class="tei tei-q">“good,”</span> as being an object or term of the Divine Will. Every
created reality is thus <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum alteri</span></span> inasmuch as it is good for
God, not, of course, in the impossible sense of perfecting Him,
but as an imitation and expression of the Goodness of the Divine
Nature Itself. The experience which enables us to reach a
knowledge of the existence and nature of God, the Creator,
Conserver, and Providence of the actual universe, also teaches us
that this universe can have no other ultimate end or good than
God Himself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> God's will to manifest His goodness by the
extrinsic glory which consists in the knowledge and love of Him
by His rational creatures. The omnipotence of the Creator,
His freedom in creating, and our knowledge of the universe He
has actually chosen to create from among indefinite possible
worlds, all alike convince us that the actual world is neither the
best possible nor the worst possible, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em> speaking. But
our knowledge of His wisdom and power also convinces us that
for the purpose of manifesting His glory in the measure and
degree in which He has actually chosen to manifest it by creating
the existing universe, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relatively</span></em> to the attainment of this
specific purpose, the existing universe is the best possible.

51. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Optimism and Pessimism.</span></span>—Those few outlines of the
philosophy of theism—theses established in Natural Theology—will
reveal to us the place of theism in relation to <span class="tei tei-q">“optimist”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“pessimist”</span> systems of philosophy. Pessimism, as an outcome
of philosophical speculation, is the proclamation in some
form or other of the conviction that human existence, nay, existence
in general, is a failure, an evil. It is the analogue, in relation
to will, of what scepticism is in relation to intellect; and
it is no less self-contradictory than the latter. While the latter
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
points to total paralysis of thought, the former involves a like
paralysis of all will, all effort, all purpose in existence—a philosophy
of despair, despondency, gloom. Both are equally erroneous,
equally indicative of philosophical failure, equally repugnant
to the normal, healthy mind. Optimism on the other hand is
expressive of the conviction that good predominates in all existence:
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">melius est esse quam non esse</span></span>; that at the root of all
reality there is a beneficent purpose which is ever being realized;
that there is in things not merely a truth that can be known but
a goodness that can be loved. Existence is not an evil, life is
not a failure. This is a philosophy of hope, buoyancy, effort and
attainment. But is it true, or is it an empty illusion? Well, to
maintain that the actual universe is the best absolutely, would, of
course, be absurd. If Leibniz's <span class="tei tei-q">“Principle of Sufficient Reason”</span>
obliged him to contend, in face of the painfully palpable facts of
physical and moral evil in the universe, that this universe is the
best absolutely possible, the best that God could create, we can
only say: so much the worse for his <span class="tei tei-q">“Principle”</span>. The true optimism
is that of the theist who, admitting the prevalence of evil
in the universe, in the sense to be explained presently, at the
same time holds that throughout creation the good predominates,
that God's beneficent purpose in regard to individuals does in the
main prevail, and that His glory is manifested in giving to rational
creatures the perfection and felicity of knowing and loving Himself.
For the theist, then, the problem of the existence of evil in
the universe assumes the general form of reconciling the fact of
evil in God's creation with the fact of God's infinite power and
goodness. This is a problem for Natural Theology. Here we
have merely to indicate some general principles arising from the
consideration of evil as the correlative and antithesis of goodness.

the existence of evil in the universe, the scholastic apparently

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If ontological goodness is really identical with actual being,
if being is good in so far as it is actual, then it would appear that
ontological evil must be identical with non-being, nothingness.
And so it is, in the sense that no evil is a positive, actual reality,
that all evil is an absence of reality. But just as the good, though
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
really identical with the actual, is nevertheless logically distinct
from the latter, so is evil logically distinct from nothingness, or
the absence of reality. As we have seen, the good is that which
perfects a nature, that which is due to a nature as the realization
of the end of the latter. So, too, is evil the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">privation</span></em> of any perfection
due to a nature, the absence of something positive and
something which ought to be present. Evil, therefore, is not a
mere negation or absence of being; it is the absence of a good,
or in other words the absence of a reality that should be present.
All privation is negation, but not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>; for privation is the
negation of something <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">due</span></em>: the absence of virtue is a mere negation
in an animal, in man it is a privation. Hence the commonly
accepted definition of evil: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Malum est privatio boni debiti</span></em>: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Evil
is the privation of the goodness due to a thing</span></em>.<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a> Evil is always,
therefore, a defect, a deficiency. The notion of evil is a relative,
not an absolute notion. As goodness is the right relation of a
nature to its proper end, so is evil a failure, a defect in this relation:
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Malum est privatio ordinis ad finem debitum</span></span>.<a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188" href="#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The very finiteness of a finite being is the absence of further
reality in this being; but as this further reality is not due to
such a being, its absence, which has sometimes been improperly
described as <span class="tei tei-q">“metaphysical evil,”</span> is not rightly regarded as evil
at all: except, indeed, we were to conceive it as happening to the
Infinite Being Himself, which would be a contradiction in thought.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Evil, then, in its formal concept is nothing positive; it is
essentially negative, or rather privative. For this very reason,
when we consider evil in the concrete, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> as affecting actual
things, as occurring in the actual universe—we can scarcely
speak of it with propriety as <span class="tei tei-q">“existing,”</span>—we see that it essentially
involves some positive, real subject which it affects, some
nature which, by affecting, it renders so far evil. Cancer in the
stomach is a real evil of the stomach, a defect, a deficiency, a
failure, in the adaptation of the stomach to its proper end. It is
not itself a positive, absolute, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">evil entity</span></em>. In so far as it is itself
a positive, physical reality, a growth of living cells, it has its own
nature, its natural tendency, its development towards an end in
accordance with biological laws: in all of which it verifies the
definition of ontological goodness. But the existence of such a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
growth in the stomach is pathological, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> a disease of the stomach,
a prevention of the natural, normal function of the stomach, a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">failure of the latter's adaptation to its end</span></em>, and hence an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">evil for
the stomach</span></em>. Lying, too, is an evil, a moral evil of man as a
moral subject. But this does not mean that the whole physical
process of thinking, judging, speaking, whereby a man lies, is
itself a positive evil entity. The thinking is itself good as a
physical act. So is the speaking in itself good as a physical act.
Whatever of positive reality there is in the whole process is good,
ontologically good. But there is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">want of conformity</span></em> of the
language with the thought, entailing a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">privation</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">failure of
adaptation</span></em> of the man as a moral subject with his end, with his
real good; and in this failure of adaptation, this privation of
goodness, lies the moral evil of lying.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Evil, then, has a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> or subjective cause, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> some
positive, actual reality, which is good in so far forth as it is
actual, but which is evil, or wanting in something due to it, in
so far as the privation which we have called evil affects it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But evil has no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> cause: formally it is not a reality
but a privation: <span class="tei tei-q">“evil has no formal cause, but is rather the
privation of a form”</span>.<a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href="#note_189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor has evil any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> cause, for it consists precisely in the
failure of a being's natural tendency towards its end, in the want
of adaptation of a nature to its end: <span class="tei tei-q">“nor has evil a final cause,
but is rather the privation of a being's due relation to its natural
end”</span>.<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a> Evil cannot be the natural result of a being's tendency
towards its end, or a means to the attainment of this end. For
that which is really an end must be good, and a means derives its
goodness from the end to which it is a means. The good, because
it is an end, or a means to an end, is desirable; and so,
too, might evil be defined <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> as that which is the object
of no natural tendency or desire, that from which all things are
averse: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">malum est quod nullum ens appetit, vel a quo omnia aversantur</span></span>.
Nor can evil be itself an end, or be as such desired or
desirable. Real evil is no doubt often sought and desired by
conscious beings, sometimes physical evil, sometimes moral evil.
But it is always desired and embraced as a good, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sub specie boni</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> when apprehended as here and now good in the sense of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gratifying, pleasure-giving, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum delectabile</span></span>. This is possible
because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pleasure</span></em>, especially organic, sensible pleasure, as distinct
from the state of real well-being which characterizes true <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">happiness</span></em>,
is not the exclusive concomitant of seeking and possessing a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> good: it often accompanies the seeking and possessing of a
merely apparent good: and in such cases it is itself a merely
apparent good, and in reality evil. The unfortunate man who
commits suicide does not embrace evil as such. He wrongly
judges death to be good, as being in his view a lesser evil than
the miseries of his existence, and under this aspect of goodness
he embraces death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally we have to inquire whether evil has an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> cause.
Seeing that it is not merely a logical figment, seeing that it
really affects actual things, that it really occurs in the actual
universe, it must have a real source among the efficient causes of
these actual things that make up the universe. It is undoubtedly
due to the action of efficient causes, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">failure</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">defective</span></em>
action, of efficient causes. But being itself something negative,
a privation, it cannot properly be said to have an <span class="tei tei-q">“efficient”</span> cause;
for the influence of an efficient cause is positive action, which in
turn must have for its term something positive, something real,
and therefore good. Hence St. Augustine very properly says
that evil should be described as having a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deficient</span></em>”</span> cause rather
than an <span class="tei tei-q">“efficient”</span> cause.<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a> In other words, evil is not the direct,
natural or normal result of the activity of efficient causes; for
this result is always good. It must therefore be always an indirect,
abnormal, accidental consequence of their activity. Let us see
how this can be—firstly in regard to physical evil, then in regard
to moral evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the action of physical causes we may distinguish between
the operative agencies themselves and the subjects in which the
effects of these operations are produced. Sometimes the effect
is wanting in due perfection, or is in other words imperfect,
physically evil, because of some defect in the agencies: the
statue may be defective because the sculptor is unskilled, or his
instruments bad; offspring may be weak or malformed owing to
some congenital or accidental weakness or unfitness in the
parents. Sometimes the evil in the effect is traceable not to the
agents but to the materials on which they have to work: the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sculptor and his instruments may be perfect, but if there be a
flaw in the marble the statue will be a failure; the educator may
be efficient, but if the pupil be wanting in aptitude or application
the results cannot be <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this, however, does not carry us very far, for we must
still inquire <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> are the agencies, or the materials, themselves
defective. Moreover, physical evil sometimes occurs without
any defect either in the agencies or in the materials. The effect
produced may be incompatible with some minor perfection
already in the subject; it can then be produced only at the
sacrifice of this minor perfection: which sacrifice is for the subject
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pro tanto</span></span> an evil. It is in the natural order of things that
the production of a new <span class="tei tei-q">“form”</span> or perfection excludes the
actuality of a pre-existing form or perfection. All nature is subject
to change, and we have seen that all change is ruled by the
law: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Generatio unius est corruptio alterius</span></span>. It might perhaps be
said that this privation or supplanting of perfections in things
by the actualization in these things of incompatible perfections,
is inherent in the nature of things and essential to their finiteness—at
least, if we regard the things not individually but as parts
of a whole, as members of a system, as subserving a general
scheme;—and that therefore such privation should not be regarded
as physical evil proper, but rather as <span class="tei tei-q">“metaphysical”</span> evil, improperly
so called. However we regard it, it can have no other
first source than the Will of the Creator decreeing the actual
order of the existing universe. And the same must be said of
the physical evils proper that are incident to the actual order of
things. These evils are <span class="tei tei-q">“accidental”</span> when considered in relation
to the individual natures of the created agencies and
materials. They are defects or failures of natural tendencies:
were these natural tendencies always realized there would be no
such evils. But they are not realized; and their <span class="tei tei-q">“failure”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“evil”</span> is not <span class="tei tei-q">“accidental”</span> in regard to God; for God has
willed and created these agencies with natural tendencies which
He has destined to be fulfilled not always and in every detail,
but in such measure as will secure the actual order of the universe
and show forth His perfections in the finite degree in
which He has freely chosen to manifest these perfections. The
world He has chosen to create is not the best absolutely possible:
there are physical evils in it; but it is the best for the exact
purpose for which He created it.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is also moral evil in the universe. In comparison with
moral evil, the physical defects in God's creation—physical pain
and suffering, material privations and hardships, decay and death
of living things—are not properly evils at all. At least they are
not evils in the same profound sense as the deliberate turning
away of the moral agent from God, his Last End and Ultimate
Good, is an evil. For the physical evils incident to individual
beings in the universe can be not only foreseen by God but
accepted and approved, so to speak, by His Will, as subserving
the realization of the total physical good which He wills in the
universe; and as subordinate to, and instrumental in the
realization of, the moral good of mankind: for it is obvious that
in the all-wise designs of Providence physical evils such as pain,
suffering, poverty, hunger, etc., may be the means of realizing
moral goodness. But moral evil, on the contrary, or, in the
language of Christian ethics, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sin</span></em>—the conscious and deliberate
rejection, by the free agent, of God who is his true good—though
necessarily foreseen by God in the universe He has
actually chosen to create, and therefore necessarily permitted by
the Will of God consequently on this foresight, cannot have
been and cannot be intended or approved by Him. Having
created man an intelligent and free being, God could not will or
decree the revolt of the latter from Himself. He loves essentially
His own Infinite Goodness: were He to identify His Will with
that of the sinning creature He would at the same time be turning
away from His Goodness: which is a contradiction in terms.
God, therefore, does not will moral evil. Nevertheless He permits
it: otherwise it would not occur, for nothing can happen
<span class="tei tei-q">“against His will”</span>. He has permitted it by freely choosing to
create this actual universe of rational and free creatures, foreseeing
that they would sin. He could have created instead a universe
of such beings, in which there would be no moral evil: for He
is omnipotent. Into the secrets of His election it is not given to
finite minds to penetrate. Acknowledging His Infinite Power,
Wisdom and Goodness, realizing at the same time the finiteness
of our faculties, we see how rational it is to bow down our minds
with St. Paul and to exclaim in admiration: <span class="tei tei-q">“O, the depth of the
riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible
are His judgments, and how unsearchable His ways!”</span><a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If it be objected that God's permission of moral evil in the
universe is really the cause of this evil, and makes God Himself
responsible for sin and its consequences, a satisfactory answer is
not far to seek. It is absolutely incompatible with God's Infinite
Sanctity that He be responsible for sin and its consequences.
For these the free will of the creature is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone</span></em> responsible. The
creation of intelligent beings, endowed with the power <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">freely</span></em> to
love, honour and serve God, is the most marvellous of all God's
works. Free will is the noblest endowment of a creature of God,
as it is also the most mysterious. Man, who by his intelligence
has the power to know God as his Supreme Good, has by his
will the power <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">freely</span></em> to tend towards God and attain to the
possession of God as his Last End. In so far as man sins, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
knowingly, deliberately, and freely violates the tendency of his
nature towards God by turning away from Him, he and he alone
is responsible for the consequences, because he has the power to
accomplish what he knows to be God's design in his regard,
and to be his true destiny and path to happiness—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> that he
tend towards union with God and the possession of God—and
he deliberately fails to make use of this power. Such
failure and its consequences are, therefore, his own; they leave
absolutely untouched and unassailed the Infinite Goodness and
Benevolence of God's eternal design in his regard.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In scholastic form, the objection is proposed and answered
in this way: <span class="tei tei-q">“The cause of a cause is the cause of the latter's
effects; but God is the cause of man, and sin is the latter's
effect; therefore God is the cause of sin”</span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“That the cause of
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">non-free</span></em> cause is the cause of the latter's effects, we admit.
That the cause of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">free</span></em> cause is the cause of the latter's effects,
at least in the sense of permitting, without intending and being
thereby responsible for them, we also admit; always in the
sense of intending and being responsible for them, we deny.
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positive effects</span></em> of a created free cause, those which the latter
by nature is intended to produce, are attributable to the first
cause or creator of the free cause, and the first cause is responsible
for them. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">failures</span></em> of the created free cause to produce its
natural and intended effects, are not due to the first cause; they
are not intended by, nor attributable to, the first cause; nor is
the latter responsible for them: they are failures of the free
cause, and of him alone; though they are of course foreseen and
permitted by the first cause or creator of the latter. The minor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
premiss of the objection we may admit—noting, however, that
sin is not properly called an effect, but rather, like all evil, a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">failure</span></em> of some cause to produce its connatural effect: it is a
defect, a deficiency, a privation of some effect, of some positive
perfection, which the cause ought naturally to have produced.
The conclusion of the objection we distinguish, according to our
analysis of the major premiss: God is the cause of sin in the
proper sense of intending it, willing it, and producing it positively,
and being thereby responsible for it, we deny; God is the cause
of sin in the improper sense of merely foreseeing and permitting
it as incidental to the universe He has actually willed and decreed
to create, as occurring in this universe by the deliberate failure
of free creatures to conform themselves to His primary benevolent
intention in their regard, we may grant. And this Divine permission
of moral evil cannot be shown to be incompatible with
any attribute of the Divinity.”</span>

In the preceding paragraphs we have barely outlined the
principles on which the philosophy of theism meets the problem
of evil in the universe. We have made assumptions which it is
the proper province of Natural Theology to establish, and to that
department also we must refer the student for a fuller treatment
of the whole problem.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been sometimes said that the fact of evil in the universe
is one of the greatest difficulties against the philosophy of
Theism. If this be taken as an insinuation that the fact of evil
can be better explained—or even as well explained—on the
assumptions of Pantheism, Monism, Manicheism, or any other
philosophy besides Theism, it is false. If it means simply that in
accounting for evil—whether on principles of Theism or of any
other philosophy—we are forced to raise some ultimate questions
in the face of which we must admit that we have come upon
depths of mystery which the plummet of our finite intellects
cannot hope to fathom, in this sense indeed the assertion may be
admitted. As we have already hinted, even with the light of the
Christian Revelation to aid the natural light of reason, there are
questions about the existence and causes of evil which we may
indeed ask, but which we cannot adequately answer. And
obviously this is no reflection on Theism; while in the latter
system we have a more intelligible and more satisfactory analysis
of the problem than in any other philosophy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the ancient Greek philosophers we find <span class="tei tei-q">“matter”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(ὕλη) identified with <span class="tei tei-q">“vacuum”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“empty space”</span> (το κενόν) and
this again with <span class="tei tei-q">“nothingness”</span> or non-being (τὸ μη νὀ). Now
the concept of evil is the concept of something negative—a
privation of goodness, of being or reality. Thus the notion of
evil came to be associated with the notion of matter. But the
latter notion is not really negative: it is that of a formless,
chaotic, disorderly material. When, therefore, the Manicheans
attributed a positive reality to evil—conceiving it as the principle
of all disorder, strife, discord—they naturally regarded all matter
as the expression of the Evil Principle, in opposition to soul or
spirit as the expression of the Good Principle. The Manichean
philosophy of Evil, a product of the early Christian centuries, has
been perhaps the most notable alternative or rival system
encountered by the theistic philosophy of Evil; for, notwithstanding
the fantastic character of its conceptions Manicheism has
reappeared and reasserted itself repeatedly in after ages, notably
in the Middle Ages. Its prevalence has probably been due
partly to the concreteness of its conceptions and partly to a
certain analogy which they bear towards the conception of Satan
and the fallen angels in Christian theology. In both cases there
is the idea of conflict, strife, active and irreconcilable opposition,
between the powers of good and the powers of evil. But there
the analogy ends. While in Christian theology the powers of
evil are presented as essentially subject to the Divine Omnipotence,
in Manicheism the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Evil Principle</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Summum Malum</span></em>, is
presented as a supreme, self-existent principle, essentially independent
of, as well as antagonistic to, the Divine Being, the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Summum Bonum</span></em>. Since there is evil in the world, and since
good cannot be the cause of evil—so the Manicheans argue—there
must be an essentially Evil First Principle which is the
primary source of all the evil in the universe, just as there is
an essentially Good First Principle which is the source of all
its good. Everything in the world—and especially man himself,
composed of matter and spirit—is the expression and the theatre
of the essential conflict which is being ever waged between the
Good and the Evil Principle. Everywhere throughout the universe
we find this dualism: between spirit and matter, light and
darkness, order and disorder, etc.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From all that has been said in the preceding paragraphs regarding
the nature and causes of good and evil the errors of the
Manichean system will be apparent. Its fundamental error is the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conception of evil as a positive entity. Evil is not a positive
entity but a privation. And this being so, its occurrence does
not demand a positive efficient cause. It can be explained and
accounted for by deficiency or failure in causes that are good in
so far forth as they are operative, but which have not all the
goodness their nature demands. And we have seen how this
failure of created causes is permitted by the First Cause, and is
not incompatible with His Infinite Goodness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides, the Manichean conception of an intrinsically evil
cause, a cause that could produce only evil, is a contradiction in
terms. The operation of an efficient cause must have a positive
term: in so far as the term is positive it is good: and therefore
its cause cannot have been totally evil, but must have been in
some degree good. The crucial point in the whole debate is
this, that we cannot conceive evil as a positive entity. By doing
so we render reality unintelligible; we destroy the fundamental
ground of any possible distinction between good and evil, thus
rendering both alike inconceivable. Each is correlative to the
other; we cannot understand the one without the other. If,
therefore, goodness is an aspect of real being, and identical with
reality, evil must be a negation of reality, and cannot be made
intelligible otherwise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, the Manichean conception of two Supreme, Self-Existent,
Independent First Principles is obviously self-contradictory.
As is shown in Natural Theology, Being that is
absolutely Supreme, Self-Existent and Necessary, must by Its
very nature be unique: there could not be two such Beings.

with these notions is that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the beautiful</span></em>,<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a> which we must now
briefly analyse. The fine arts have for their common object the
expression of the beautiful; and the department of philosophy
which studies these, the philosophy of the beautiful, is generally

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Like the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“true”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“good,”</span> the term <span class="tei tei-q">“beautiful”</span>
(καλόν; <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pulchrum</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">beau</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">schön</span></span>, etc.) is familiar to all. To reach
a definition of it let us question experience. What do men
commonly mean when, face to face with some object or event,
they say <span class="tei tei-q">“That is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beautiful</span></em>”</span>? They give expression to this
sentiment in the presence of a natural object such as a landscape
revealing mountain and valley, lake and river and plain and
woodland, glowing in the golden glow of the setting sun; or in
contemplating some work of art—painting, sculpture, architecture,
music: the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sistine Madonna</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moses</span></span> of Michael Angelo, the
Cathedral of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Notre Dame</span></span>, a symphony of Beethoven; or some
literary masterpiece: Shakespeare's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macbeth</span></span>, or Dante's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Divina
Commedia</span></span>, or Newman's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apologia</span></span>, or Kickham's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Knocknagow</span></span>.
There are other things the sight of which arouses no such sentiment,
but leaves us indifferent; and others again, the sight of
which arouses a contrary sentiment, to which we give expression
by designating them as <span class="tei tei-q">“commonplace,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“vulgar,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“ugly”</span>. The
sentiment in question is one of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pleasure</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">approval</span></em>, or of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">displeasure</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disapproval</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence the first fact to note is that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the beautiful pleases us</span></em>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">affects us agreeably</span></em>, while the commonplace or the ugly leaves us
indifferent or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">displeases us</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">affects us disagreeably</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> pleases us and affects us agreeably. Is the
beautiful, then, identical with the good? No; the really beautiful
is indeed always good; but not everything that is good is
beautiful; nor is the pleasure aroused by the good identical with
that aroused by the beautiful. Whatever gratifies the lower
sense appetites and causes organic pleasure is good—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum
delectabile</span></span>—but is not deemed beautiful. Eating and drinking,
resting and sleeping, indulging the senses of touch, taste and
smell, are indeed pleasure-giving, but they have no association
with the beautiful. Again, the deformed child may be the object of
the mother's special love. But the pleasure thus derived from
the good, as the object of appetite, desire, delight, is not esthetic
pleasure. If we examine the latter, the pleasure caused by the
beautiful, we shall find that it is invariably a pleasure peculiar to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em>, to apprehension, perception, imagination, contemplation.
Hence in the domain of the senses we designate as
<span class="tei tei-q">“beautiful”</span> only what can be apprehended by the two higher
senses, seeing and hearing, which approximate most closely to
intellect, and which, through the imagination, furnish data for
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contemplation</span></em> to the intellect.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> This brings us to St. Thomas's
definition: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Pulchra sunt quæ visa placent</span></span>: those things are beautiful
whose vision pleases us,—where vision is to be understood in
the wide sense of apprehension, contemplation.<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> The owner of
a beautiful demesne, or of an art treasure, may derive pleasure
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from his sense of proprietorship; but this is distinct from the
esthetic pleasure that may be derived by others, no less than by
himself, from the mere contemplation of those objects. Esthetic
pleasure is disinterested: it springs from the mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contemplation</span></em>
of an object as beautiful; whereas the pleasure that springs from
the object as good is an interested pleasure, a pleasure of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possession</span></em>. No doubt the beautiful is really identical with the
good, though logically distinct from the latter.<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">orderliness</span></em>
which we shall see to be the chief objective factor of beauty, is
itself a perfection of the object, and as such is good and desirable.
Hence the beautiful can be an object of interested desire, but
only under the aspect of goodness. Under the aspect of beauty
the object can excite only the disinterested esthetic pleasure of
contemplation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if esthetic pleasure is derived from contemplation, is not
this identifying the beautiful with the true, and supplanting art
by science? Again the consequence is inadmissible; for not
every pleasure peculiar to knowledge is esthetic. There is a
pleasure in seeking and discovering truth, the pleasure which
gratifies the scholar and the scientist: the pleasure of the philologist
in tracing roots and paradigms, of the chemist in analysing
unsavoury materials, of the anatomist in exploring the structure
of organisms <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">post mortem</span></span>. But these things are not <span class="tei tei-q">“beautiful”</span>.
The really beautiful is indeed always true, but it cannot well be
maintained that all truths are beautiful. That two and two are
four is a truth, but in what intelligible sense could it be said to
be beautiful?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But besides the scientific pleasure of seeking and discovering
truth, there is the pleasure which comes from contemplating the
object known. The aim of the scientist or scholar is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to discover
truth</span></em>; that of the artist is, through knowledge to derive complacency
from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contemplating the thing known</span></em>. The scientist or
scholar may be also an artist, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>; but the scientist's
pleasure proper lies exclusively in discovering truth, whereas
that of the artist lies in contemplating something apprehended,
imagined, conceived. The artist is not concerned as to whether
what he apprehends is real or imaginary, certain or conjectural,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but only as to whether or how far the contemplation of it will
arouse emotions of pleasure, admiration, enthusiasm; while the
scientist's supreme concern is to know things, to see them as
they are. The beautiful, then, is always true, either as actual or
as ideal; but the true is beautiful only when it so reveals itself
as to arouse in us the desire to see or hear it, to consider it, to
dwell and rest in the contemplation of it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us accept, then, the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> definition of the beautiful
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that which it is pleasing to contemplate</span></em>; and before inquiring
what precisely is it, on the side of the object, that makes the
latter agreeable to contemplate, let us examine the subjective
factors and conditions of esthetic experience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
54. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Esthetic Sentiment. Apprehension of the
Beautiful.</span></span>—We have seen that both the appetitive and the
cognitive faculties are involved in the experience of the beautiful.
Contemplation implies cognition; while the feeling of pleasure,
complacency, satisfaction, delight, indicates the operation of
appetite or will. Now the notion of the beautiful, like all our
notions, has its origin in sense experience; but it is itself
suprasensible for it is reached by abstraction, and this is above
the power of sense faculties. While the senses and imagination
apprehend beautiful objects the intellect attains to that which
makes these objects beautiful, to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ratio pulchri</span></span> that is in them.
No doubt, the perception or imagination of beautiful things, in
nature or in art, produces as its natural concomitant, a feeling of
sensible pleasure. To hear sweet music, to gaze on the brilliant
variety of colours in a gorgeous pageant, to inhale delicious
perfumes, to taste savoury dishes—all such experiences gratify
the senses. But the feeling of such sensible pleasure is quite
distinct from the esthetic enjoyment which accompanies the
apprehension of the beautiful; though it is very often confounded
with the latter. Such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sentient</span></em> states of agreeable feeling are
mainly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive</span></em>, organic, physiological; while esthetic enjoyment,
the appreciation of the beautiful, is eminently <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active</span></em>. It implies
the operation of a suprasensible faculty, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligence</span></em>; it
accompanies the reaction of the latter faculty to some appropriate
objective stimulus of the suprasensible, intelligible order, to
some <span class="tei tei-q">“idea”</span> embodied in the object of sense.<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The error of confounding esthetic enjoyment with mere
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
organic sense pleasure is characteristic of all sensist and
materialist philosophies. A feeling of sensible gratification
always, no doubt, accompanies our apprehension and enjoyment
of the beautiful; for just as man is not a merely sentient being
so neither is he a pure intelligence. Beauty reaches him through
the senses; in order that an object be beautiful for him, in order
that the contemplation of it may please him, it must be in
harmony with his whole <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">human</span></em> nature, which is both sentient
and intelligent; it must, therefore, be agreeable to the senses
and imagination as well as to the intellect. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no
painting,”</span> writes M. Brunetière,<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“but should be above all a joy
to the eye! no music but should be a delight for the ear!”</span>
Otherwise we shall not apprehend in it the order, perfection,
harmony, adaptation to human nature, whereby we pronounce
an object beautiful and rejoice in the contemplation of it. And
it is this intellectual activity that is properly esthetic. <span class="tei tei-q">“What
makes us consider a colour beautiful,”</span> writes Bossuet,<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> is the
secret judgment we pronounce upon its adaptation to the eye
which it pleases. Beautiful sounds, songs, cadences, have a
similar adaptation to the ear. To apprehend this adaptation
promptly and accurately is what is described as having a good
ear, though properly speaking this judgment should be attributed
to the intellect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to some the esthetic sentiment, the appreciation
and enjoyment of the beautiful, is an exclusively subjective experience,
an emotional state which has all its sources within the
conscious subject, and which has no real, extramental correlative
in things. According to others beauty is already in the extramental
reality independently of any subjective conditions, and
has no mental factors in its constitution as an object of
experience. Both of these extreme views are erroneous.
Esthetic pleasure, like all pleasure, is the natural concomitant of
the full, orderly, normal exercise of the subject's conscious
activities. These activities are called forth by, and exercised
upon, some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object</span></em>. For esthetic pleasure there must be in the
object something the contemplation of which will elicit such
harmonious exercise of the faculties. Esthetic pleasure, therefore,
cannot be purely subjective: there must be an objective
factor in its realization. But on the other hand this objective
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
factor cannot provoke esthetic enjoyment independently of the
dispositions of the subject. It must be in harmony with those
dispositions—cognitive, appetitive, affective, emotional, temperamental—in
order to evoke such a mental view of the object
that the contemplation of the latter will cause esthetic pleasure.
And it is precisely because these dispositions, which are so
variable from one individual to another, tinge and colour the
mental view, while this in turn determines the quality of the
esthetic judgment and feeling, that people disagree and dispute
interminably about questions of beauty in art and nature.
Herein beauty differs from truth. No doubt people dispute
about the latter also; but at all events they recognize its
objective character and the propriety of an appeal to the independent,
impersonal standard of evidence. Not so, however,
in regard to beauty: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">De gustibus non est disputandum</span></span>: there is
no disputing about tastes. The perception of beauty, the judgment
that something is or is not beautiful, is the product of an
act of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">taste</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of the individual's intelligence affected by
numerous concrete personal dispositions both of the sentient and
of the spiritual order, not only cognitive and appetitive but
temperamental and emotional. Moreover, besides this variety
in subjective dispositions, we have to bear in mind the effects of
artistic culture, of educating the taste. The eye and the ear,
which are the two main channels of data for the intellect, can be
made by training more delicate and exacting, so that the same
level of esthetic appreciation can be maintained only by a
constantly increasing measure of artistic stimulation. Finally,
apart from all that a beautiful object <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">directly conveys</span></em> to us for
contemplation, there is something more which it may <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indirectly
suggest</span></em>: it arouses a distinct activity of the imagination whereby
we fill up, in our own individual degree and according to our
own interpretation, what has not been actually supplied in it by
nature or art.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All those influences account sufficiently for the subjectivity
and variability of the esthetic sentiment, for diversity of artistic
tastes among individuals, for the transitions of fashion in art
from epoch to epoch and from race to race. But it must not
be concluded that the subjective factors in the constitution of
the beautiful are wholly changeable. Since human nature is
fundamentally the same in all men there ought to be a fund of
esthetic judgments and pleasures common to all; there ought to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be in nature and in art some things which are recognized and
enjoyed as beautiful by all. And there are such. In matters
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of detail</span></em> the maxim holds: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">De gustibus non disputandum</span></span>. But
there are fundamental esthetic judgments for which it does not
hold. Since men have a common nature, and since, as we shall
see presently, there are recognizable and stable objective factors
to determine esthetic judgments, there is a legitimate foundation
on which to discuss and establish some esthetic canons of universal
validity.

then is it that makes them beautiful, and so causes the esthetic
pleasure we experience in contemplating them? In order that an
object produce pleasure of any sort in a conscious being it must
evoke the exercise of this being's faculties; for the conscious
condition which we describe as pleasure is always a reflex of
conscious activity. Furthermore, this activity must be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">full</span></em> and

ill-regulated, wrongly distributed among the faculties, it will not
have pleasure for its reflex, but either indifference or pain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence the object which evokes the esthetic pleasure of contemplation
must in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> place be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">complete</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect</span></em> of its

animal, the crippled human being, are not beautiful. They are
wanting in the integrity due to their nature.
</p>

But this is not enough. To be beautiful, the object must in
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> place have a certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">largeness</span></em> or amplitude, a certain

but this energy must not be excessive, it must not dazzle, it
must be in proportion to the capacity of our faculties.<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em> requisite for beauty is that the object be in itself
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">duly proportioned</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">orderly</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">well arranged</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Order</span></em> generally may
be defined as right or proper arrangement. We can see in
things a twofold order, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dynamic</span></em>, or that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subordination</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">static</span></em>,
or that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">co-ordination</span></em>: the right arrangement of means towards
ends, and the right arrangement of parts in a whole, or members
in a system. The former indicates the influence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> causes
and expresses primarily the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">goodness</span></em> of things. The latter is determined
by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> causes of things and expresses primarily
their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beauty</span></em>. The order essential to beauty consists in this, that
the manifold and distinct things or acts which contribute to it
must form one whole. Hence order has been defined as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unity in
variety</span></em>: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">unitas in varietate</span></span>; variety being the material cause, and
unity the formal cause, of order. But we can apprehend unity
in a variety of things only on condition that they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arranged</span></em>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> that they show forth clearly to the mind a set of mutual relations
which can be easily grasped. Why is it that things
mutually related to one another in one way make up what we
declare to be a chaotic jumble, while if related in another way we
declare them to be orderly? Because unless these relations present
themselves in a certain way they will fail to unify the manifold
for us. We have an intellectual intuition of the numerical
series; and of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proportion</span></em>, which is equality of numerical relations.
In the domains of magnitude and multitude the mind naturally
seeks to detect these proportions. So also in the domains of
sensible qualities, such as sounds and colours, we have an
analogous intuition of a qualitative series, and we naturally try to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
detect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">harmony</span></em>, which is the gradation of qualitative relations in
this series. The detection of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proportion</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">harmony</span></em> in a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">variety</span></em>
of things pleases us, because we are thus enabled to grasp
the manifold as exhibiting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unity</span></em>; while the absence of these
elements leaves us with the dissatisfied feeling of something
wanting. Whether this be because order in things is the expression
of an intelligent will, of purpose and design, and therefore
calls forth our intelligent and volitional activity, with its consequent
and connatural feeling of satisfaction, we do not inquire
here. But certain it is that order is essential to beauty, that
esthetic pleasure springs only from the contemplation of proportion
and harmony, which give unity to variety.<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href="#note_204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a> And the
explanation of this is not far to seek. For the full and vigorous
exercise of contemplative activity we need objective variety.
Whatever lacks variety, and stimulates us in one uniform manner,
becomes monotonous and causes <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ennui</span></span>. While on the other
hand mere multiplicity distracts the mind, disperses and weakens
attention, and begets fatigue. We must, therefore, have variety,
but variety combined with the unity that will concentrate and
sustain attention, and thus call forth the highest and keenest
energy of intellectual activity. Hence the function of rhythm in
music, poetry and oratory; of composition and perspective in
painting; of design in architecture.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The more perfect the relations are which constitute order,
the more <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">clearly</span></em> will the unity of the object <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shine forth</span></em>; hence
the more fully and easily will it be grasped, and the more intense

56. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Some Definitions of the Beautiful.</span></span>—An object is
beautiful when its contemplation pleases us; and this takes
place when the object, complete and entire in itself, possesses
that order, harmony, proportion of parts, which will call forth
the full and vigorous exercise of our cognitive activity. All this
amounts to saying that the beauty of a thing is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">revelation or
manifestation of its natural perfection</span></em>.<a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href="#note_206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a> Perfection is thus the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foundation</span></em> of beauty; the showing forth of this perfection is what
constitutes beauty <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em>. Every real being has a nature
which constitutes it, and activities whereby it tends to realize
the purpose of its existence. Now the perfection of any nature
is manifested by the proportion of its constitutive parts and by
the harmony of all its activities. Hence we see that order is
essential to beauty because order shows forth the perfection of
the beautiful. An object is beautiful in the degree in which the
proportion of its parts and the harmony of its activities show
forth the perfection of its nature.

call the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> or synthetic definition, which emphasizes the

57. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Classifications. The Beautiful in Nature.</span></span>—All
real beauty is either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">artificial</span></em>. Natural beauty is that
which characterizes what we call the <span class="tei tei-q">“works of Nature”</span> or
the <span class="tei tei-q">“works of God”</span>. Artificial beauty is the beauty of <span class="tei tei-q">“works
of art”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, just as we can distinguish the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> beauty of the latter
from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideal</span></em> beauty which the human artist conceives in his
mind as its archetype and exemplar cause, so, too, we can distinguish
between the real beauty of natural things and the ideal
beauty of their uncreated archetypes in the Mind of the Divine
Artist.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We know that the beauty of the human artist's ideal is
superior to, and never fully realized in, that of the actually
achieved product of his art. Is the same true of the natural
beauty of God's works? That the works of God in general are
beautiful cannot be denied; His Wisdom <span class="tei tei-q">“spreads beauty
abroad”</span> throughout His works; He arranges all things according
to weight and number and measure:<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cum pondere, numero et
mensura</span></span>; His Providence disposes all things strongly and
sweetly: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fortiter et suaviter</span></span>. But while creatures, by revealing
their own beauty, reflect the Uncreated beauty of God in the
precise degree which He has willed from all eternity, it cannot
be said that they all realize the beauty of their Divine
Exemplars according to His primary purpose and decree. Since
there is physical and moral evil in the universe, since there are
beings which fail to realize their ends, to attain to the perfection
of their natures, it follows that these beings are not beautiful.
In so far forth as they have real being, and the goodness or perfection
which is identical with their reality, it may be admitted
that all real beings are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fundamentally</span></em> beautiful; for goodness or
perfection is the foundation of beauty.<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a> But in so far as they fail
to realize the perfection due to their natures they lack even the
foundation of beauty. Furthermore, in order that a thing
which has the full perfection due to its nature be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em> beautiful,
it must actually show forth by the clearness of its proportions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the harmony of its activities the fulness of its natural perfections.
But there is no need to prove that this is not universally
verified in nature—or in art either. And hence we must infer
that formal beauty is not a transcendental attribute of reality.<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Real beauty may be further divided into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensible</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellectual</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritual</span></em>. The former reveals itself
to hearing, seeing and imagination; the latter can be apprehended
only by intellect; but intellect depends for all its objects on the
data of the imagination. The beauty of spiritual realities is of
course of a higher, nobler and more excellent order than that of
the realities of sense. The spiritual beauty which falls directly
within human experience is that of the human spirit itself; from
the soul and its experiences we can rise to an apprehension—analogical
and inadequate—of the Beauty of the Infinite Being.
In the soul itself we can distinguish two sources of beauty: what
we may call its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></em> endowments such as intellect and will,
and its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em> dispositions, its perfections and excellences as a
free, intelligent, moral agent—its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">virtues</span></em>. Beauty of soul, especially
the moral beauty of the virtuous soul, is incomparably
more precious than beauty of body. The latter, of course, like all
real beauty in God's creation, has its proper dignity as an expression
and revelation, however faint and inadequate, of the Uncreated
Beauty of the Deity. But inasmuch as it is so inferior
to the moral beauty proper to man, in itself so frail and evanescent,
in its influence on human passions so dangerous to virtue, we
can understand why in the Proverbs of Solomon it is proclaimed
to be vain and deceitful in contrast with the moral beauty of
fearing the Lord: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Fallax gratia et vana est pulchritudo; mulier
timens dominum ipsa laudabitur</span></span>.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a>

Fine Arts.</span></span>—The expression of beauty is the aim of the fine arts.
Art in general is <span class="tei tei-q">“the proper conception of a work to be accomplished”</span>:
<span class="tei tei-q">“ars nihil aliud est quam recta ratio aliquorum operum
faciendorum”</span>.<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href="#note_214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a> While the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mechanical</span></em> arts aim at the production
of things useful, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fine</span></em> arts aim at the production of things
beautiful, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of works which by their order, symmetry, harmony,
splendour, etc., will give such apt expression to human ideals of
natural beauty as to elicit esthetic enjoyment in the highest possible
degree. The artist, then, must be a faithful student and
admirer of all natural beauty; not indeed to aim at exact reproduction
or imitation of the latter; but to draw therefrom his
inspiration and ideals. Even the most beautiful things of nature
express only inadequately the ideal beauty which the human
mind may gather from the study of them. This ideal is what the
artist is ever struggling to express, with the ever-present and
tormenting consciousness that the achievement of his highest effort
will fall immeasurably short of giving adequate expression to it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If each of the things of nature were so wholly simple and intelligible
as to present the same ideal type of beauty to all, and
leave no room for individual differences of interpretation, there
would be no variety in the products of artistic genius, except
indeed what would result from perfect or imperfect execution.
But the things of nature are complex, and in part at least enigmatical;
they present different aspects to different minds and
suggest a variety of interpretations; they leave large scope to the
play of the imagination both as to conception of the ideal
itself and as to the arrangement and manipulation of the sensible
materials in which the ideal is to find expression. By means of
these two functions, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conception</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">expression</span></em>, the genius of the
artist seeks to interpret and realize for us ideal types of natural
beauty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The qualities of a work of art, the conditions it must fulfil,
are those already enumerated in regard to beauty generally. It
must have unity, order, proportion of parts; it must be true to
nature, not in the sense of a mere copy, but in the sense of
drawing its inspiration from nature, and so helping us to understand
and appreciate the beauties of nature; it must display a
power and clearness of expression adjusted to the capacity of the
normal mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may add—as indicating the connexion of art with morality—that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the work of art must not be such as to excite disapproval
or cause pain by shocking any normal faculty, or running counter
to any fundamental belief, sympathy, sentiment or feeling, of the
human mind. The contemplation of the really beautiful, whether
in nature or in art, ought <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span> to have an elevating, ennobling,
refining influence on the mind. But the beautiful is not the
good; nor does the cultivation of the fine arts necessarily enrich
the mind <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morally</span></em>. From the ethical point of view art is one of
those indifferent things which the will can make morally good or
morally evil. Since man is a moral being, no human interest can
fall outside the moral sphere, or claim independence of the moral
law; and art is a human interest. Neither the creator, nor the
critic, nor the student of a work of art can claim that the latter,
simply because it is a work of art, is neither morally good nor
morally bad; or that he in his special relation to it is independent
of the moral law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Under the specious plea that science in seeking truth is
neither positively moral nor positively immoral, but abstracts
altogether from the quality of morality, it is sometimes claimed
that, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a pari</span></span>, art in its pursuit of the beautiful should be held to
abstract from moral distinctions and have no concern for moral
good or evil. But in the first place, though science as such seeks
simply the true, and in this sense abstracts from the good and
the evil, still the man of science both in acquiring and communicating
truth is bound by the moral law: he may not, under the
plea that he is learning or teaching truth, do anything <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morally
wrong</span></em>, anything that will <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forfeit or endanger moral rectitude</span></em>,
whether in himself or in others. And in the second place, owing
to the different relations of truth and beauty to moral goodness,
we must deny the parity on which the argument rests. Truth
appeals to the reason alone; beauty appeals to the senses, the
heart, the will, the passions and emotions: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Pulchrum trahit ad
se desiderium</span></span>”</span>. The scientist expresses truth in abstract laws,
definitions and formulas: a law of chemistry will help the farmer
to fertilize the soil, or the anarchist to assassinate sovereigns.
But the artist expresses beauty in concrete forms calculated to
provoke emotions of esthetic enjoyment from the contemplation
of them. Now there are other pleasure-giving emotions, sensual
and carnal emotions, the indiscriminate excitement and unbridled
indulgence of which the moral law condemns as evil; and if a
work of art be of such a kind that it is directly calculated to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
excite them, the artist stands condemned by the moral law, and
that even though his aim may have been to give expression to
beauty and call forth esthetic enjoyment merely. If the preponderating
influence of the artist's work on the normal human
individual be a solicitation of the latter's nature towards what is
evil, what is opposed to his real perfection, his moral progress,
his last end, then that artist's work is not a work of art or truly
beautiful. The net result of its appeal being evil and unhealthy,
it cannot be itself a thing of beauty.

beautiful; and a means as such cannot be </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">for its own sake</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. But it may
signify that art should subserve no </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> purpose, professional or utilitarian;
that it should be disinterested; that the artist must aim at the conception
and expression of the beautiful through a disinterested admiration and
enthusiasm for the beautiful. In this sense the formula expresses a principle
which is absolutely true, and which asserts the noble mission of the artist to
mankind. But the formula is also commonly understood to claim the emancipation
of the artist from the bonds of morality, and his freedom to conceive
and express beauty in whatever forms he pleases, whether these may aid men
to virtue or solicit them to vice. This is the pernicious error to which we
have just referred. And we may now add that this erroneous contention is
not only ethically but also </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">artistically</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> unsound. For surely art ought to be
based on truth: the artist should understand human nature, to which his
work appeals: he should not regard as truly beautiful a work the contemplation
of which will produce a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">discord</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> in the soul, which will </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">disturb the right
order</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of the soul's activities, which will solicit the lower faculties to revolt
against the higher; and this is what takes place when the artist ignores moral
rectitude in the pursuit of his art: by despising the former he is false to the
latter. He fails to realize that the work of art must be judged not merely in
relation to the total </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">amount</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of pleasure it may cause in those who contemplate
it, but also in relation to the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">quality</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of this pleasure; and not merely in
relation to esthetic pleasure, but in relation to the total effect, the whole concrete
influence of the work on all the mental faculties. He fails to see that
if this total influence is evil, the work that causes it cannot be good nor therefore
really beautiful.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Are we to conclude, then, that the artist is bound to aim positively and
always at producing a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">good moral effect</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> through his work? By no means.
Esthetic pleasure is, as we have said, indifferent. The pursuit of it, through
the conception and expression of the beautiful, is the proper and intrinsic end
of the fine arts, and is in itself legitimate so long as it does not run counter to
the moral law. It has no need to run counter to the moral law, nor can it do
so without defeating its own end. Outside its proper limits art ceases to be
art; within its proper limits it has a noble and elevating mission; and it can
serve indirectly but powerfully the interests of truth and goodness by helping
men to substitute for the lower and grosser pleasures of sense the higher and
purer esthetic pleasures which issue from the disinterested contemplation of
the beautiful.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
59. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Conception of Ultimate Categories.</span></span>—Having
examined so far the notion of real being itself, which is the
proper subject-matter of ontology, and those widest or transcendental
notions which are coextensive with that of reality,
we must next inquire into the various modes in which we find
real being expressed, determined, actualized, as it falls within
our experience. In other words, we must examine the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">highest
categories of being</span></em>, the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">suprema genera entis</span></span>. Considered from
the point of view of the logical arrangement of our concepts,
each of these categories reveals itself as a primary and immediate
limitation of the extension of the transcendental concept of
real being itself. Each is ultimately distinct from the others
in the sense that no two of them can be brought under any
other as a genus, nor can we discover any intermediate notion
between any one of them and the notion of being itself. The
latter notion is not properly a genus of which they would be
species, nor can it be predicated univocally of any two or more
of them (<a href="#Section_2" class="tei tei-ref">2</a>). Each is itself an ultimate genus, a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genus supremum</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By using these notions as predicates of our judgments we are
enabled to interpret things, to obtain a genuine if inadequate
insight into reality; for we assume as established in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Theory
of Knowledge</span></em> that all our universal concepts have real and objective
validity, that they give us real knowledge of the nature
of those individual things which form the data of our sense
experience. Hence the study of the categories, which is for
Logic a classification of our widest concepts, become for Metaphysics
an inquiry into the modes which characterize real being.<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a>
By determining what these modes are, by studying their characteristics,
by tracing them through the data of experience, we
advance in our knowledge of reality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most divergent views have prevailed among philosophers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
both as to what a category is or signifies, and as to what or how
many the really ultimate categories are. Is a category, such as
substance, or quality, or quantity, a mode of real being revealed
to the knowing mind, as most ancient and medieval philosophers
thought, with Aristotle and St. Thomas? or is it a mental mode
imposed on reality by the knowing mind, as many modern
philosophers have thought, with Kant and after him? It is for
the Theory of Knowledge to examine this alternative; nor shall
we discuss it here except very incidentally: for we shall assume
as true the broad affirmative answer to the first alternative.
That is to say, we shall hold that the mind is able to see, in the
categories generally, modes of reality; rejecting the sceptical
conclusions of Kantism in regard to the power of the Speculative
Reason, and the principles which lead to such conclusions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the number and classification of the ultimate categories,
this is obviously a question which cannot be settled <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
priori</span></span> by any such purely deductive analysis of the concept of
being as Hegel seems to have attempted; but only <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> by an analysis of experience in its broadest sense as including
Matter and Spirit, Nature and Mind, Object and Subject of
Thought, and even the Process of Thought itself. Moreover it
is not surprising that with the progress of philosophical reflection,
certain categories should have been studied more deeply at
certain epochs than ever previously, that they should have been
<span class="tei tei-q">“discovered”</span> so to speak, not of course in the sense that the
human mind had not been previously in possession of them, but
in the sense that because of closer study they furnished the mind
with a richer and fuller power of <span class="tei tei-q">“explaining”</span> things. It is
natural, too, that historians of philosophy, intent on tracing the
movement of philosophic thought, should be inclined to over-emphasize
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relativity</span></em> of the categories, as regards their <span class="tei tei-q">“explaining”</span>
value—their relativity to the general mentality of a
certain epoch or period.<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a> But there is danger here of confounding
certain large <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hypothetical conceptions</span></em>, which are found to yield
valuable results at a certain stage in the progress of the sciences,<a id="noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href="#note_217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a>
with the categories proper of real being. If the mind of man is
of the same nature in all men, if it contemplates the same universe,
if it is capable of reaching truth about this universe—real
truth which is immutable,—then the modes of being which it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apprehends in the universe, and by conceiving which it interprets
the latter, must be in the universe as known, and must be
there immutably. Nowhere do we find this more clearly illustrated
than in the futility of the numerous attempts of modern
philosophers to deny the reality of the category of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em>, and
to give an intelligible interpretation of experience without the
aid of this category. We shall see that as a matter of fact it is
impossible to deny <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in thought</span></em> the reality of substance, or to
think at all without it, however philosophers may have denied
it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in language</span></em>,—or thought that they denied it when they only
rejected some erroneous or indefensible meaning of the term.

60. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Aristotelian Categories.</span></span>—The first palpable
distinction we observe in the data of experience is that between
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accident</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">“We might naturally ask,”</span> writes Aristotle,<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a>

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feeling well</span></em>, is a being (or reality).... And we might be
inclined to doubt it, for no single one of such acts <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exists by itself</span></em>
(καθ᾽ αὐτὸ πεφυκός), no one of them is separable from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em>
(οὐσία); it is rather to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him who</span></em> walks, or sits, or feels well, that
we give the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em>. That which is a being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the primary
meaning of this term</span></em>, a being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simply and absolutely</span></em>, and not merely
a being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in a certain sense</span></em>, or with a qualification, is substance—ὡστε

But manifestly, though substances, or what in ordinary language
we call <span class="tei tei-q">“persons”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span>—men, animals, plants, minerals—are
real beings in the fullest sense, nevertheless sitting, walking,
thinking, willing, and actions generally, are also undoubtedly
realities; so too are states and qualities; and shape, size, posture,
etc. And yet we do not find any of these latter actually existing
in themselves like substances, but only dependently on substances—on
<span class="tei tei-q">“persons”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span> that think or walk or act, or are
large or small, hot or cold, or have some shape or quality. They
are all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidents</span></em>, in contradistinction to substance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is far easier to distinguish between accidents and substance
than to give an exhaustive list of the ultimate and irreducible
classes of the former. Aristotle enumerates <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nine</span></em>: Quantity
(ποσόν), Quality (ποῖον), Relation (πρὸς τι), Action (ποιέιν),
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Passion (πάσχειν), Where (ποῦ), When (ποτέ), Posture (κεῖσθαι),
External Condition or State (ἔχειν). Much has been said for and
against the exhaustive character of this classification. Scholastics
generally have defended and adopted it. St. Thomas gives the
following reasoned analysis of it:<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a> Since accidents may be distinguished
by their relations to substance, we see that some affect
substances intrinsically, others extrinsically; and in the former
case, either absolutely or relatively: if relatively we have the
category of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relation</span></em>; if absolutely we have either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantity</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quality</span></em> according as the accident affects the substance by reason
of the matter, or the form, of the latter. What affects and denominates
a substance extrinsically does so either as a cause, or
as a measure, or otherwise. If as a cause, the substance is either
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffering</span></em> action, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acting</span></em> itself; if as a measure, it denominates
the subject as in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em>, or in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">place</span></em>, or in regard to the relative
position of its parts, its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">posture</span></em>, in the place which it occupies.
Finally, if the accident affects the substance extrinsically, though
not as cause or as measure, but only as characterizing its external
condition and immediate surroundings, as when we describe a
man as clothed or armed, we have the category of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">condition</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It might be said that all this is more ingenious than convincing;
but it is easier to criticize Aristotle's list than to suggest a
better one. In addition to what we have said of it elsewhere,<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a>
a few remarks will be sufficient in the present context.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some of the categories, as being of lesser importance, we may
treat incidentally when dealing with the more important ones.
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ubi</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quando</span></span>, and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Situs</span></span>, together with the analysis of our notions
of Space and Time, fall naturally into the general doctrine of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quantity</span></em>. The final category, ἔχειν, however interpreted,<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a> may
be referred to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quality</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quantity</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Relation</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A more serious point for consideration is the fact, generally
admitted by scholastics,<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a> that one and the same real accident may
belong to different categories if we regard it from different standpoints.
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Actio</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passio</span></span> are one and the same <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motus</span></span> or change,
regarded in relation to the agent and to the effect, respectively.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Place</span></em>, in regard to the located body belongs to the category <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ubi</span></span>,
whereabouts; in regard to the locating body it is an aspect of the
latter's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantity</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Relation</span></em>, as we shall see, is probably not an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
entity really distinct from its foundation—quality, quantity, or
causality. The reason alleged for this partial absence of real
distinction between the Aristotelian categories is that they were
thought out primarily from a logical point of view—that of predication.<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href="#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a>
And the reason is a satisfactory one, for real distinction
is not necessary for diversity of predication. Then, where they
are not really distinct entities these categories are at least aspects
so fundamentally distinct and mutually irreducible that each of
them is indeed a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">summum genus</span></span> immediately under the concept
of being in general.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems a bold claim to make for any scheme of categories,
that it exhausts all the known modes of reality. We often
experience objects of thought which seem at first sight incapable
of reduction to any of Aristotle's <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">suprema genera</span></span>. But more
mature reflection will always enable us to find a place for them.
In order that any extrinsic denomination of a substance constitute
a category distinct from those enumerated, it must affect
the substance <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in some real</span></em> way distinct from any of those nine;
and it must moreover <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">be not a mere complex or aggregate</span></em> of two
or more of the latter. Hence denominations which objects
derive from the fact that they are terms of mental activities
which are really immanent, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actiones</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">intentionales</span></span>,”</span>—denominations
such as <span class="tei tei-q">“being known,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“being loved,”</span>—neither belong to
the category of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passio</span></span>”</span> proper, nor do they constitute any distinct
category. They are <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span>, logical relations. Again,
while efficient causation resolves itself into the categories of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio</span></span>
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passio</span></span>, the causation of final, formal and material causes
cannot be referred to these categories, but neither does it constitute
any new category. The influence of a final cause consists
in nothing more than its being a good which is the term of
appetite or desire. The causation of the formal cause consists
in its formally constituting the effect: it is always either a substantial
or an accidental form, and so must be referred to the
categories of substance, or quality, or quantity. Similarly
material causality consists in this that the matter is a partial
constitutive principle of the composite being; and it therefore
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
refers us to the category of substance. It may be noted, too,
that the ontological principles of a composite being—such as
primal matter and substantial form—since they are themselves
not properly <span class="tei tei-q">“beings,”</span> but only <span class="tei tei-q">“principles of being,”</span> are said to
belong each to its proper category, not formally but only referentially,
not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formaliter</span></span> but only <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">reductivé</span></span>. Finally, the various
properties that are assigned to certain accidents themselves are
either logical relations (such as <span class="tei tei-q">“not having a contrary”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“being a measure”</span>), or real relations, or intrinsic modes of the
accident itself (as when a quality is said to have a certain
<span class="tei tei-q">“intensity”</span>); but in all cases where they are not mere logical
entities they will be found to come under one or other of the
Aristotelian categories.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“real being”</span> which is thus <span class="tei tei-q">“determined”</span> into the
supreme modes or categories of substance and accidents is, of
course, <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> considered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantially</span></em> as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> (whether

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existential</span></em> being, in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">participial</span></em> sense. Furthermore, it is
primarily finite or created being that is so determined. The
Infinite Being is above the categories, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">super</span></em>-substantial. It is
because substance is the most perfect of the categories, and
because the Infinite Being verifies in Himself in an incomprehensibly
perfect manner all the perfections of substance, that we
speak of Him as a substance: remembering always that these
essentially finite human concepts are to be predicated of Him

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be inquired whether <span class="tei tei-q">“accident”</span> is a genus which
should be predicated <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">univocally</span></em> of the nine Aristotelian categories
as species? or is the concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“accident”</span> only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">analogical</span></em>, so
that these nine categories would be each a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">summum genus</span></span> in the
strict sense, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> an ultimate and immediate determination of the
concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> itself? We have seen already that the concept
of <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> as applied to <span class="tei tei-q">“substance”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“accident”</span> is
analogical (<a href="#Section_2" class="tei tei-ref">2</a>). So, too, it is analogical as applied to the various

that of <span class="tei tei-q">“affecting, inhering in”</span> a subject, can scarcely be
said to be verified <span class="tei tei-q">“in the same way,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“univocally,”</span> of the
various kinds of accidents; it is therefore more probably correct
not to regard <span class="tei tei-q">“accident”</span> as a genus proper, but to conceive each
kind of accident as a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">summum genus</span></span> coming immediately under
the transcendental concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span>.

61. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Phenomenist Attack on the Traditional
Doctrine of Substance.</span></span>—Passing now to the question of the
existence and nature of substances, and their relation to accidents,
we shall find evidences of misunderstandings to which many
philosophical errors may be ascribed at least in part. It is a
fairly common contention that the distinction between substance
and accident is really a groundless distinction; that we have
experience merely of transient events or happenings, internal and
external, with relations of coexistence or sequence between them;
that it is an illusion to suppose, underlying these, an inert, abiding
basis called <span class="tei tei-q">“substance”</span>; that this can be at best but a useless
name for each of the collections of external and internal appearances
which make up our total experience of the outer world
and of our own minds. This is the general position of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phenomenists</span></em>.
<span class="tei tei-q">“What do you know of substance,”</span> they ask us,
<span class="tei tei-q">“except that it is an indeterminate and unknown something
underlying phenomena? And even if you could prove its existence,
what would it avail you, since in its nature it is, and
must remain, unknown? No doubt the mind naturally supposes
this <span class="tei tei-q">‘something’</span> underlying phenomena; but it is a mere
mental fiction the reality of which cannot be proved, and the
nature of which is admitted, even by some who believe in its real
existence, to be unknowable.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now there can be no doubt about the supreme importance of
this question: all parties are pretty generally agreed that on the
real or fictitious character of substance the very existence of
genuine metaphysics in the traditional sense depends. And at
first sight the possibility of such a controversy as the present
one seems very strange. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is it credible,”</span> asks Mercier,<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“that
thinkers of the first order, like Hume, Mill, Spencer, Kant,
Wundt, Paulsen, Littré, Taine, should have failed to recognize
the substantial character of things, and of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego</span></em> or Self?
Must they not have seen that they were placing themselves in
open revolt against sound common sense? And on the other
hand is it likely that the genius of Aristotle could have been
duped by the naïve illusion which phenomenists must logically
ascribe to him? Or that all those sincere and earnest teachers
who adopted and preserved in scholastic philosophy for centuries
the peripatetic distinction between substance and accidents
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
should have been all utterly astray in interpreting an elementary
fact of common sense?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There must have been misunderstandings, possibly on both
sides, and much waste of argument in refuting chimeras. Let us
endeavour to find out what they are and how they gradually arose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Phenomenism has had its origin in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Idealism</span></em> which confines
the human mind to a knowledge of its own states, proclaiming
the unknowability of any reality other than these; and in the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Positivism</span></em> which admits the reality only of that which falls
directly within external and internal sense experience. Descartes
did not deny the substantiality of the soul, nor even of bodies;
but his idealist theory of knowledge rendered suspect all information
derived by his deductive, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> method of reasoning from
supposed innate ideas, regarding the nature and properties of
bodies. Locke rejected the innatism of Descartes, ascribing to
sense experience a positive rôle in the formation of our ideas, and
proving conclusively that we have no such intuitive and deductively
derived knowledge of real substances as Descartes contended
for.<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a> Locke himself did not deny the existence of substances,<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a>
any more than Descartes. But unfortunately he propounded the
mistaken assumption of Idealism, that the mind can know only
its own states; and also the error of thinking that because we
have not an intuitive insight into the specific nature of individual
substances we can know nothing at all through any channel about
their nature: and he gathered from this latter error a general
notion or definition of substance which is a distinct departure
from what Aristotle and the medieval scholastics had traditionally
understood by substance. For Locke substance is merely
a supposed, but unknown, support for accidents.<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a> Setting out
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with these two notions—that all objects of knowledge must be
states or phases of mind, and that material substance is a supposed,
but unknown and unknowable, substratum of the qualities revealed
to our minds in the process of sense perception—it was
easy for Berkeley to support by plausible arguments his denial
of the reality of any such things as material substances. And it
was just as easy, if somewhat more audacious, on the part of
Hume to argue quite logically that if the supposed but unknowable
substantial substratum of external sense phenomena is illusory,
so likewise is the supposed substantial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego</span></em> which is thought
to underlie and support the internal phenomena of consciousness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hume's rejection of substance is apparently complete and
absolute, and is so interpreted by many of his disciples. But a
thorough-going phenomenism is in reality impossible; no philosophers
have ever succeeded in thinking out an intelligible theory
of things without the concepts of <span class="tei tei-q">“matter,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit,”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“things,”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ego”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Self,”</span> however they may have tried
to dispense with them; and these are concepts of substances.
Hence there are those who doubt that Hume was serious in his
elaborate reasoning away of substances. The fact is that Hume
<span class="tei tei-q">“reasoned away”</span> substance only in the sense of an unknowable
substratum of phenomena, and not in the sense of a something
that exists in itself.<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a> So far from denying the existence of entities
that exist in themselves, he seems to have multiplied these beyond
the wildest dreams of all previous philosophers <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by substantializing
accidents</span></em>.<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a> What he does call into doubt is the capacity of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the human mind to attain to a knowledge of the specific natures
of such entities; and even here the arguments of phenomenism
strike the false Cartesian theory of knowledge, rather than the
sober and moderate teachings of scholasticism regarding the
nature and limitations of our knowledge of substances.

62. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Scholastic View of our Knowledge in regard
to the Existence and Nature of Substances.</span></span>—What, then,
are these latter teachings? That we have a direct, intellectual
insight into the specific essence or nature of a corporeal substance
such as gold, similar to our insight into the abstract essence of
a triangle? By no means; Locke was quite right in rejecting
the Cartesian claim to intuitions which were supposed to yield
up all knowledge of things by <span class="tei tei-q">“mathematical,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> deductive,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> reasoning. The scholastic teaching is briefly as
follows:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, as regards our knowledge of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existence</span></em> of substances,
and the manner in which we obtain our concept of substance. We
get this concept from corporeal substances, and afterwards apply
it to spiritual substances; so that our knowledge of the former
is <span class="tei tei-q">“immediate”</span> only in the relative sense of being prior to the
latter, not in the sense that it is a direct intuition of the natures
of corporeal substances. We have no such direct insight into
their natures. But our concept of them as actually existing is
also immediate in the sense that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at first</span></em> we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spontaneously</span></em> conceive
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every</span></em> object which comes before our consciousness <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as something
existing in itself</span></em>. The child apprehends each separate stimulant
of its sense perception—resistance, colour, sound, etc.—as a
<span class="tei tei-q">“this ”</span>or a <span class="tei tei-q">“that,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> as a separate something, existing there
in itself; in other words it apprehends all realities as substances:
not, of course, that the child has yet any reflex knowledge of what
a substance is, but unknowingly it applies to all realities at first
the concept which it undoubtedly possesses <span class="tei tei-q">“something existing
in itself”</span>. It likewise apprehends each such reality as <span class="tei tei-q">“one”</span>
or <span class="tei tei-q">“undivided in itself,”</span> and as <span class="tei tei-q">“distinct from other things”</span>.
Such is the child's immediate, direct, and implicit idea of substance.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But if we are to believe Hume, what is true of the
child remains true of the man: for the latter, too, <span class="tei tei-q">“every perception
is a substance, and every distinct part of a perception a distinct
substance”</span>.<a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a> Nothing, however, could be more manifestly at
variance with the facts. For as reason is developed and reflective
analysis proceeds, the child most undoubtedly realizes that not
everything that falls within its experience has the character of
<span class="tei tei-q">“a something existing in itself and distinct from other things”</span>.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Walking,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“talking,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“actions”</span> generally, it apprehends
as realities,—as realities which, however, do <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“exist in themselves,”</span>
but in other beings, in the beings that <span class="tei tei-q">“walk”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“talk”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“act”</span>. And these latter beings it still apprehends
as <span class="tei tei-q">“existing in themselves,”</span> and as thus differing from the former,
which <span class="tei tei-q">“exist not in themselves but in other things”</span>. Thus the
child comes into possession of the notion of <span class="tei tei-q">“accident,”</span> and of
the further notion of <span class="tei tei-q">“substance”</span> as something which not only
exists in itself (οὐσία, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens in se subsistens</span></span>), but which is also a
support or subject of accidents (ὑποκείμενον, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">substans</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">substare</span></span>).<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>
Nor, indeed, need the child's reason be very highly developed in
order to realize that if experience furnishes it with <span class="tei tei-q">“beings that
do not exist in themselves,”</span> there must also be beings which do
exist in themselves: that if <span class="tei tei-q">“accidents”</span> exist at all it would be
unintelligible and self-contradictory to deny the existence of
<span class="tei tei-q">“substances”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the order of our experience</span></em> the first, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">implicit</span></em> notion
of substance is that of <span class="tei tei-q">“something existing in itself”</span> (οὐσία);
the first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">explicit</span></em> notion of it, however, is that by which it is apprehended
as <span class="tei tei-q">“a subject or support of accidents”</span> (ὑποκείμενον,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sub-stare</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">substantia</span></span>); then by reflection we go back to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">explicit</span></em>
notion of it as <span class="tei tei-q">“something existing in itself”</span>. In the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ontological</span></em> order the perfection of <span class="tei tei-q">“existing in itself”</span> is manifestly
more fundamental than that of <span class="tei tei-q">“supporting accidents”</span>.
It is in accordance with a natural law of language that we name
things after the properties whereby they reveal themselves to us,
rather than by names implying what is more fundamental and
essential in them. <span class="tei tei-q">“To exist in itself”</span> is an absolute perfection,
essential to substance; <span class="tei tei-q">“to support accidents”</span> is only a relative
perfection; nor can we know <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> but a substance might
perhaps exist without any accidents: we only know that accidents
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cannot exist without some substance, or subject, or power which
will sustain them in existence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Can substance be apprehended by the senses, or only by
intellect? Strictly speaking, only by intellect: it is neither a
<span class="tei tei-q">“proper object”</span> of any one sense, such as taste, or colour, or
sound; nor a <span class="tei tei-q">“common object”</span> of more than one sense, as extension
is with regard to sight and touch: it is, in scholastic
language, not a <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensibile per se</span></span>,”</span> not itself an object of sense
knowledge, but only <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensibile per accidens</span></span>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> it may be said to
be <span class="tei tei-q">“accidentally”</span> an object of sense because of its conjunction
with accidents which are the proper objects of sense: so that
when the senses perceive accidents what they are really perceiving
is the substance affected by the accidents. But strictly and properly
it is by intellect we consciously grasp that which in the
reality is the substance: while the external and internal sense
faculties make us aware of various qualities, activities, or other
accidents external to the <span class="tei tei-q">“self,”</span> or of various states and conditions
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“self,”</span> the intellect—which is a faculty of the same
soul as the sense faculties—makes us simultaneously aware of
corporeal substances actually existing outside us, or of the concrete
substance of the <span class="tei tei-q">“ego”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“self,”</span> existing and revealing itself
to us in and through its conscious activities, as the substantial,
abiding, and unifying subject and principle of these conscious
activities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, then, do we attain to the concept of substance in
general, to a conviction of the concrete actual existence of that
mode of being the essential characteristic of which is <span class="tei tei-q">“to exist in
itself”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the next place, how do we reach a knowledge of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specific
natures</span></em> of substances?<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a> What is the character, and what are the
limitations, of such knowledge? Here, especially, the very
cautious and moderate doctrine of scholasticism has been largely
misconceived and misrepresented by phenomenists and others.
About the specific nature of substances we know just precisely
what their accidents reveal to us—that and no more. We have
no intuitive insight into their natures; all our knowledge here is
abstractive and discursive. As are their properties—their activities,
energies, qualities, and all their accidents—so is their nature.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
We know of the latter just what we can infer from the former.
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Operari sequitur esse</span></span>; we have no other key than this to knowledge
of their specific natures. We have experience of them only
through their properties, their behaviour, their activities; analysis
of this experience, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> reasoning from it, inductive
generalization based upon it: such are the only channels we
possess, the only means at our disposal, for reaching a knowledge
of their natures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

63. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phenomenist Difficulties against this View. Its
Vindication.</span></span>—Now the phenomenist will really grant all this.
His only objection will be that such knowledge of substance is
really no knowledge at all; or that, such as it is, it is useless. But
surely the knowledge that this mode of being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really exists</span></em>, that
there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> a mode of being which <span class="tei tei-q">“exists in itself,”</span> is already some
knowledge, and genuine knowledge, of substance? No doubt,
the information contained in this very indeterminate and generic
concept is imperfect; but then it is only a starting point, an
all-important starting point, however; for not only is it perfectible
but every item of knowledge we gather from experience perfects
it, whereas without it the intellect is paralysed in its attempt to
interpret experience: indeed so indispensable is this concept of
substance to the human mind that, as we have seen, no philosopher
has ever been really able to dispense with it. When
phenomenists say that what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> call mind is only a bundle of
perceptions and ideas; when they speak of the flow of events,
which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ourselves</span></em>, of which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> are conscious,<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a> the very language
they themselves make use of cries out against their professed
phenomenism. For why speak of <span class="tei tei-q">“we,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“ourselves,”</span> etc., if
there be no <span class="tei tei-q">“we”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“ourselves”</span> other than the perceptions,
ideas, events, etc., referred to?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of course the explanation of this strange attitude on the part
of these philosophers is simple enough; they have a wrong conception
of substance and of the relation of accidents thereto; they
appear to imagine that according to the traditional teaching
nothing of all we can discover about accidents—or, as they prefer
to term them, <span class="tei tei-q">“phenomena”</span>—can possibly throw any light upon
the nature of substance: as if the rôle of phenomena were to
cover up and conceal from us some sort of inner core (which they
call substance), and not rather to reveal to us the nature of that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“being, existing in itself,”</span> of which these phenomena are the
properties and manifestations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The denial of substance leads inevitably to the substantializing
of accidents. It is possible that the manner in which some
scholastics have spoken of accidents has facilitated this error.<a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href="#note_235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a>
Anyhow the error is one that leads inevitably to contradictions in
thought itself. Mill, for instance, following out the arbitrary
postulates of subjectivism and phenomenism, finally analysed all
reality into present sensations of the individual consciousness,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em> permanent possibilities of sensations. Now, consistently
with the idealistic postulate, these <span class="tei tei-q">“permanent possibilities”</span>
should be nothing more than a certain tone, colouring, quality of
the <span class="tei tei-q">“present”</span> sensation, due to the fact that this has in it, as part
and parcel of itself, feelings of memory and expectation; in which
case the <span class="tei tei-q">“present sensation,”</span> taken in its concrete fulness, would
be the sole reality, and would exist in itself. This <span class="tei tei-q">“solipsism”</span> is
the ultimate logical issue of subjective idealism, and it is a sufficient
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">reductio ad absurdum</span></span> of the whole system. Or else, to evade
this issue, the <span class="tei tei-q">“permanent possibilities”</span> are supposed to be
something really other than the <span class="tei tei-q">“present sensations”</span>. In which
case we must ask what Mill can mean by a <span class="tei tei-q">“permanent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possibility</span></em>”</span>.
Whether it be subjective or objective possibility, it is
presumably, according to Mill's thought, some property or appurtenance
of the individual consciousness, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> a quality proper
to a subject or substance.<a id="noteref_236" name="noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a> But to deny that the conscious subject
is a substance, and at the same time to contend that it is a
<span class="tei tei-q">“permanent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possibility</span></em> of sensation,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> that it has properties
which can appertain only to a substance, is simply to hold what
is self-contradictory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After these explanations it will be sufficient merely to state
formally the proof that substances really exist. It is exceedingly
simple, and its force will be appreciated from all that has been
said so far: Whatever we become aware of as existing at all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must exist either in itself, or by being sustained, supported in
existence, in something else in which it inheres. If it exists in
itself it is a substance; if not it is an accident, and then the
<span class="tei tei-q">“something else”</span> which supports it, must in turn either exist in
itself or in something else. But since an infinite regress in things
existing not in themselves but in other things is impossible, we
are forced to admit the reality of a mode of being which exists

individual elements in the inorganic universe, whatever these
may be (<a href="#Section_31" class="tei tei-ref">31</a>). Nor does the universal interaction of these individuals
on one another, or their manifold forms of interdependence
on one another throughout the course of their ever-changing
existence and activities, interfere in any way with the substantiality
of the mode of being of each. These mutual relations of

the universe a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>, thus endowing it with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unity of order</span></em>,

Let us now meet the objection of Hume: that there is no
substantial soul distinct from its acts, that it is only the sum-total
of the acts, each of these being a substance. The objection
has been repeated in the metaphorical language in which Huxley
and Taine speak of the soul, the living soul, as nothing more
than a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">republic</span></em> of conscious states, or the movement of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">luminous
sheaf</span></em> etc. And Locke and Berkeley had already contended
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that an apple or an orange is nothing more than a collection or
sum-total of sensible qualities, so that if we conceive these removed
there is nothing left, for beyond these there was nothing
there.

Now we admit that the substance of the soul is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adequately</span></em>
distinct from its acts, or the substance of the apple or orange

distinction (<a href="#Section_38" class="tei tei-ref">38</a>) between substance and accidents as would involve
the separability of the latter from the former. But that
the acts of the soul are so many really distinct entities, each <span class="tei tei-q">“existing

<span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span> is merely a title we give to their sum-total; and similarly
the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“apple”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“orange”</span> merely titles of collections of
qualities each of which would be an entity existing in itself and
really distinct from the others, each in other words a substance,—this
we entirely deny. We regard it as utterly unreasonable
of phenomenists thus to multiply substances. Our contention is
that the individual soul or mind is one substance, and that it is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">partially</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em>, though <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not adequately</span></em>, distinct from the various
conscious acts, states, processes, functions, which are certainly
themselves real entities,—entities, however, the reality of which
is dependent on that of the soul, entities which this dependent
or <span class="tei tei-q">“inhering”</span> mode of being marks off as distinct in their nature,
and incapable of total identification with that other non-inhering

the soul.

We cannot help thinking that this phenomenist denial of

substance, with its consequent inevitable substantialization of
accidents, is largely due to a mistaken manner of regarding the
concrete existing object as a mere mechanical bundle of distinct
and independent abstractions. Every aspect of it is mentally
isolated from the others and held apart as an <span class="tei tei-q">“impression,”</span> an
<span class="tei tei-q">“idea,”</span> etc. Then the object is supposed to be constituted by,
and to consist of, a sum-total of these separate <span class="tei tei-q">“elements,”</span>
integrated together by some sort of mental chemistry. The
attempt is next made to account for our total conscious experience
of reality by a number of principles or laws of what is
known as <span class="tei tei-q">“association of ideas”</span>. And phenomenists discourse
learnedly about these laws in apparent oblivion of the fact that
by denying the reality of any substantial, abiding, self-identical
soul, distinct from the transient conscious states of the passing
moment, they have left out of account the only reality capable
of <span class="tei tei-q">“associating”</span> any mental states, or making mental life at
all intelligible. Once the soul is regarded merely as <span class="tei tei-q">“a series
of conscious states,”</span> or a <span class="tei tei-q">“stream of consciousness,”</span> or a succession
of <span class="tei tei-q">“pulses of cognitive consciousness,”</span> such elementary

Experience, therefore, does reveal to us the real existence
of substances, of <span class="tei tei-q">“things that exist in themselves,”</span> and likewise
the reality of other modes of being which have their actuality
only by inhering in the substances which they affect. <span class="tei tei-q">“A substance,”</span>
says St. Thomas, <span class="tei tei-q">“is a thing whose nature it is to exist

to exist in another.”</span><a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a> Every concrete being that falls within
our experience—a man, an oak, an apple—furnishes us with
the data of these two concepts: the being existing in itself, the
substance; and secondly, its accidents. The former concept
comprises only constitutive principles which we see to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em>
to that sort of being: the material, the vegetative, the sentient,
the rational principle, in a man, or his soul and his body; the
material principle and the formal or vital principle in an apple.
The latter concept, that of accidents, comprises only those
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
characteristics of the thing which are no doubt real, but which
do not constitute the essence of the being, which can change or
be absent without involving the destruction of that essence.
An intellectual analysis of our experience enables us—and, as
we have remarked above, it alone enables us—to distinguish
between these two classes of objective concepts, the concept of
the principles that are essential to the substance or being that
exists in itself, and the concept of the attributes that are
accidental to this being; and experience alone enables us, by
studying the latter group, the accidents of the being, whether
naturally separable or naturally inseparable from the latter,
to infer from those accidents whatever we can know about the
former group, about the principles that constitute the specific
nature of the particular kind of substance that may be under
investigation.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may, perhaps, be urged against all this, that experience
does <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> warrant our placing a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> distinction between the
entities we describe as <span class="tei tei-q">“accidents”</span> and those which we claim to
be constitutive of the <span class="tei tei-q">“substance,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“thing which exists in
itself”</span>; that all the entities without exception, which we
apprehend by distinct concepts in any concrete existing being
such as a man, an oak, or an apple, are only one and the same
individual reality looked at under different aspects; that the
distinction between them is only a logical or mental distinction;
that we separate in thought what is one in reality because we
regard each aspect in the abstract and apart from the others;
that to suppose in any such concrete being the existence of two
distinct modes of reality—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> a reality that exists in itself, and
other realities inhering in this latter—is simply to make the
mistake of transferring to the real order of concrete things what
we find in the logical order of conceptual abstractions.

This objection, which calls for serious consideration, leads to a
different conclusion from the previous objection. It suggests the
conclusion, not that substances are unreal, but that accidents are
unreal. Even if it were valid it would leave untouched the
existence of substances. We hope to meet it satisfactorily by
establishing presently the existence of accidents really distinct
from the substances in which they inhere. While the objection
draws attention to the important truth that distinctions recognized
in the conceptual order are not always real, it certainly does not
prove that all accidents are only mentally distinct aspects of substance.

For surely a man's thoughts, volitions, feelings, emotions,
his conscious states generally, changing as they do from moment
to moment, are not really identical with the man himself who
continues to exist throughout this incessant change; yet they
are realities, appearing and disappearing and having all their
actuality in him, while he persists as an actual being <span class="tei tei-q">“existing

64. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Erroneous Views on the Nature of Substance.</span></span>—If
we fail to remember that the notion of substance, as <span class="tei tei-q">“a being
existing in itself and supporting the accidents which affect it,”</span>
is a most abstract and generic notion; if we transfer it in this
abstract condition to the real order; if we imagine that the
concrete individual substances which actually exist in the real
order merely verify this widest notion and are devoid of all
further content; that they possess in themselves no further richness
of reality; if we forget that actual substances, in all the
variety of their natures, as material, or living, or sentient, or
rational and spiritual, are indeed full, vibrant, palpitating with
manifold and diversified reality; if we rob them of all this perfection
or locate it in their accidents as considered apart from
themselves,—we are likely to form very erroneous notions both
of substances and of accidents, and of their real relations to one
another. It will help us to form accurate concepts of them,
concepts really warranted by experience, if we examine briefly
some of the more remarkable misconceptions of substance that
have at one time or other gained currency.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Substance is not a concrete core on which concrete
accidents are superimposed, or a sort of kernel of which they
form the rind. Such a way of conceiving them is as misleading
as it is crude and material. No doubt the language which, for
want of better, we have to employ in regard to substance and
accidents, suggests fancies of that kind: we speak of substance
<span class="tei tei-q">“supporting,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“sustaining”</span> accidents, and of these as <span class="tei tei-q">“supported
by,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“inhering in”</span> the former. But this does not really
signify any juxtaposition or superposition of concrete entities.
The substance is a subject determinable by its various accidents;
these are actualizations of its potentiality; its relation to them is
the relation of the potential to the actual, of a <span class="tei tei-q">“material”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“determinable”</span> subject to <span class="tei tei-q">“formal”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“determining”</span> principles.
But the appearance or disappearance of accidents never
takes place in the same concrete subject: by their variations the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
concrete subject is changed: at any instant the substance affected
by its accidents is one individual concrete being (<a href="#Section_27" class="tei tei-ref">27</a>), and the
inevitable result of any modification in them is that this individual,
concrete being is changed, is no longer the same. No doubt, it
preserves its substantial identity throughout accidental change, but
not its concrete identity,—that is to say, not wholly. This is the
characteristic of every finite being, subject to change and existing
in time: it has the actuality of its being, not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tota simul</span></span>, but only
gradually, successively (<a href="#Section_10" class="tei tei-ref">10</a>). From this, too, we see that although
substance is a more perfect mode of being than accident—because
the former exists in itself while the latter has its actuality only
in something else,—nevertheless, created, finite substance is a
mode of being which is itself imperfect, and perfectible by
accidents: another illustration of the truth that all created
perfection is only relative, not absolute. To the notion of <span class="tei tei-q">“inherence”</span>
we shall return in connexion with our treatment of
accidents (<a href="#Section_65" class="tei tei-ref">65</a>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Again, substance is wrongly conceived as an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inert</span></em> substratum
underlying accidents. This false notion appears to
have originated with Descartes: he conceived the two great
classes of created substances, matter and spirit, as essentially
inert. For him, matter is simply a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">res extensa</span></span>; extension in
three dimensions constitutes its essence, and extension is of
course inert: all motion is given to matter and conserved in it
by God. Spirit or soul is simply a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">res cogitans</span></span>, a being whose
essence is thought; but in thinking spirit too is passive, for it
simply receives ideas as wax does the impress of a seal. Nay,
even when soul or spirit wills it is really inert or passive, for
God puts all its volitions into it.<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a> From these erroneous conceptions
the earlier disciples of Descartes took the obvious step
forward into Occasionalism; and to them likewise may be traced
the conviction of many contemporary philosophers that the
human soul—a being that is so eminently vital and active—cannot
possibly be a substance: neither indeed could it be, if
substance were anything like what Descartes conceived it to be.
The German philosophers, Wundt and Paulsen, for example,
argue that the soul cannot be a substance. But when we inquire
what they mean by substance, what do we find? That with
them the concept of substance applies only to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corporeal</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
universe, where it properly signifies the atoms which are <span class="tei tei-q">“the
absolutely permanent substratum, qualitatively and quantitatively
unchangeable, of all corporeal reality”</span>.<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a> No wonder they would
argue that the soul is not a substance!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No actually existing substance is inert. What is true, however,
is this, that when we conceive a being as a substance, when
we think of it under the abstract concept of substance, we of
course abstract from its concrete existence as an active agent;
in other words we consider it not from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dynamic</span></em>, but from
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">static</span></em> aspect, not as it is in the concrete, but as constituting
an object of abstract thought: and so the error of Descartes
seems to have been that already referred to,—the mistake of
transferring to the real order conditions that obtain only in the
logical order.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) To the Cartesian conception of substances as inert entities
endowed only with motions communicated to them <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ab extra</span></span>, the
mechanical or atomist conception of reality, as it is called, Leibniz
opposed the other extreme conception of substances as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essentially
active entities</span></em>. For him substance is an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens præditum vi agendi</span></span>:
activity is the fundamental note in the concept of substance.
These essentially active entities he conceived as being all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simple</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unextended</span></em>, the corporeal no less than the spiritual ones.
And he gave them the title of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">monads</span></em>. It is unnecessary for
our present purpose to go into any details of his ingenious
dynamic theory of the universe as a vast system of these monads.
We need only remark that while combating the theory of inert
substances he himself erred in the opposite extreme. He conceived
every monad as endowed essentially with active tendency or effort
which is never without its effect,—an exclusively <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immanent</span></em> effect,
however, which is the constant result of constant immanent
action: for he denied the possibility of transitive activity, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio
transiens</span></span>; and he conceived the immanent activity of the monad
as being in its nature <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perceptive</span></em>,<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a> that is to say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cognitive</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">representative</span></em>,
in the sense that each monad, though <span class="tei tei-q">“wrapt up in
itself, doorless and windowless,”</span> if we may so describe it, nevertheless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mirrors more or less inchoatively, vaguely, or clearly, all
other monads, and is thus itself a miniature of the whole universe,
a microcosm of the macrocosm. Apart from the fancifulness
of his whole system, a fancifulness which is, however, perhaps
more apparent than real, his conception of substance is much
less objectionable than that of Descartes. For as a matter of
fact every individual, actually existing substance is endowed with
an internal directive tendency towards some term to be realized
or attained by its activities. Every substance has a transcendental
relation to the operations which are natural to it, and
whereby it tends to realize the purpose of its being. But nevertheless
substance should not be defined by action, for all action
of created substances is an accident, not a substance; nor even by
its transcendental relation to action, for when we conceive it
under this aspect we conceive it as an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agent</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>, not as a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em> simply. The latter concept abstracts from action and
reveals its object simply as <span class="tei tei-q">“a reality existing in itself”</span>. When
we think of a substance as a principle of action we describe it
by the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) A very widespread notion of substance is the conception of
it as a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">permanent</span></em>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stable</span></em>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">persisting</span></em>”</span> subject of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transient</span></em>,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ephemeral</span></em>”</span> realities called accidents or phenomena. This view
of substance is mainly due to the influence of Kant's philosophy.
According to his teaching we can think the succession of
phenomena which appear to our sense consciousness only by the
aid of a pure intuition in which our sensibility apprehends them,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em>. Now the application of the category of substance to
this pure intuition of our sensibility engenders a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">schema</span></em> of the
imagination, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">persistence</span></em> of the object in time. Persistence,
therefore, is for him the essential note of substance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Herbert Spencer, too, has given apt expression to this widely
prevalent notion: <span class="tei tei-q">“Existence means nothing more than persistence;
and hence in Mind that which persists in spite of all
changes, and maintains the unity of the aggregate in defiance of
all attempts to divide it, is that of which existence in the full
sense of the word must be predicated—that which we must
postulate as the substance of Mind in contradistinction to the
varying forms it assumes. But if so, the impossibility of knowing
the substance of Mind is manifest.”</span><a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, substance is conceived as the unique but hidden and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unknowable basis of all the phenomena which constitute the
totality of human experience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What is to be said of such a conception? There is just this
much truth in it: that substance is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relatively</span></em> stable or permanent,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> in comparison with accidents; the latter cannot survive
the destruction or disappearance of the substance in which they
inhere, while a substance can persist through incessant change of
its accidents. But accidents are not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em> ephemeral, nor is
substance <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em> permanent: were an accident to exist for
ever it would not cease to be an accident, nor would a substance
be any less a substance were it created and then instantaneously
annihilated. But in the latter case the human mind could not
apprehend the substance; for since all human cognitive experience
takes place <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in time</span></em>, which involves <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">duration</span></em>, the mind can
apprehend a substance only on condition that the latter has
some permanence, some appreciable duration in existence. This
fact, too, explains in some measure the error of conceiving permanence
as essential to a substance. But the error has another
source also: Under the influence of subjective idealism philosophers
have come to regard the individual's consciousness of his
own self, the consciousness of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego</span></em>, as the sole and unique
source of our concept of substance. The passage we have just
quoted from Spencer is an illustration. And since the spiritual
principle of our conscious acts is a permanent principle which
abides throughout all of them, thus explaining the unity of the
individual human consciousness, those who conceive substance
in general after the model of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego</span></em>, naturally conceive it as an
essentially stable subject of incessant and evanescent processes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is quite arbitrary thus to conceive the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego</span></em> as the sole
type of substance. Bodies are substances as well as spirits,
matter as well as mind. And the permanence of corporeal substances
is merely relative. Nevertheless they are really substances.
The relative stability of spirit which is immortal, and
the relative instability of matter which is corruptible, have
nothing to do with the substantiality of either. Both alike are
substances, for both alike have that mode of being which consists
in their existing in themselves, and not by inhering in other
things as accidents do.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) Spencer's conception of substance as the permanent, unknowable
ground of phenomena, implies that substance is one,
not manifold, and thus suggests the view of reality known as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Monism</span></em>. There is yet another mistaken notion of substance,
the notion in which the well known pantheistic philosophy of
Spinoza has had its origin. Spinoza appears to have given the
ambiguous definition of Descartes—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Substantia est res quae ita
existit, ut nulla alia re indigeat ad existendum</span></span>”</span>—an interpretation
which narrowed its application down to the Necessary
Being; for he defined substance in the following terms: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Per
substantiam intelligo id quod est in se et per se concipitur: hoc est, id
cujus conceptus non indiget conceptu alterius rei a quo formari
debeat</span></span>”</span>. By the ambiguous phrase, that substance <span class="tei tei-q">“requires no
other thing for existing,”</span> Descartes certainly meant to convey
what has always been understood by the scholastic expression
that substance <span class="tei tei-q">“exists <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em> itself”</span>. He certainly did not mean
that substance is a reality which <span class="tei tei-q">“exists <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of</span></em> itself,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> that it is
what scholastics mean by <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ens a se</span></span>, the Being that has its
actuality from its own essence, by virtue of its very nature, and
in absolute independence of all other being; for such Being is
One alone, the Necessary Being, God Himself, whereas Descartes
clearly held and taught the real existence of finite, created substances.<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a>
Yet Spinoza's definition of substance is applicable
only to such a being that our concept of this being shows forth
the actual existence of the latter as absolutely explained and
accounted for by reference to the essence of this being itself, and
independently of any reference to other being. In other words,
it applies only to the Necessary Being. This conception of substance
is the starting-point of Spinoza's pantheistic philosophy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, the scholastic definition of substance and Spinoza's
definition embody two entirely distinct notions. Spinoza's
definition conveys what scholastics mean by the Self-Existent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Being, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ens a se</span></span>; and this the scholastics distinguish from caused
or created being, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens ab alio</span></span>. Both phrases refer formally and
primarily, not to the mode of a being's existence when it does
exist, but to the origin of this existence in relation to the being's
essence; and specifically it marks the distinction between the
Essence that is self-explaining, self-existent, essentially actual
(<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> se”</span>), the Necessary Being, and essences that do not themselves
explain or account for their own actual existence, essences
that have not their actual existence from themselves or of
themselves, essences that are in regard to their actual existence
contingent or dependent, essences which, therefore, if they actually
exist, can do so only dependently on some other being
whence they have derived this existence (<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ab</span></em> alio”</span>) and on
which they essentially depend for its continuance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not the least evil of Spinoza's definition is the confusion caused
by gratuitously wresting an important philosophical term like
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em> from its traditional sense and using it with quite a different
meaning; and the same is true in its measure of the other
mistaken notions of substance which we have been examining.
By defining substance as an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens in se</span></span>, or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per se stans</span></span>, scholastic
philosophers mean simply that substance does not depend <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsically</span></em>
on any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> cause in which its actuality
would be supported; they do not mean to imply that it does not
depend <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsically</span></em> on an efficient cause from which it has its
actuality and by which it is conserved in being. They assert
that all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">created</span></em> substances, no less than all accidents, have their
being <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ab alio</span></span>”</span> from God; that they exist only by the Divine
creation and conservation, and act only by the Divine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em>
or concurrence; but while substances and accidents are both alike
dependent on this extrinsic conserving and concurring influence
of a Divine, Transcendent Being, substances are exempt from this
other and distinct mode of dependence which characterizes accidents:
intrinsic dependence on a subject in which they have their
actuality.<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href="#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a>

65. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Nature of Accident. Its Relation to Substance.
Its Causes.</span></span>—From all that has preceded we will have
gathered the general notion of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accident</span></em> as that mode of real being
which is found to have its reality, not by existing in itself, but
by affecting, determining, some substance in which it inheres as
in a subject. What do we mean by saying that accidents <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inhere
in</span></em> substances as their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjects</span></em>? Here we must at once lay aside
as erroneous the crude conception of something as located spatially
within something else, as contained in container, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
water in a vessel; and the equally crude conception of something
being in something else as a part is in the whole, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> an arm
is in the body. Such imaginations are wholly misleading.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The actually existing substance has its being or reality; it is
an actual essence. Each real accident of it is likewise a reality,
and has an essence, distinct from that of the substance, yet not
wholly independent of the latter: it is a determination of the
determinable being of the substance, affecting or modifying the
latter in some way or other, and having no other <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'être</span></span>
than this rôle of actualizing in some specific way some receptive
potentiality of the concrete substance. And since its reality is
thus dependent on that of the substance which it affects, we cannot
ascribe to it actual essence or being in the same sense as we
ascribe this to substance, but only analogically<a id="noteref_248" name="noteref_248" href="#note_248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a> (<a href="#Section_2" class="tei tei-ref">2</a>). Hence
scholastics commonly teach that we ought to conceive an accident
rather as an <span class="tei tei-q">“entity <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of an entity</span></em>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“ens <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entis</span></em>,”</span> than as an entity
simply; rather as inhering, indwelling, affecting (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>-esse) some
subject, than simply as existing itself (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">esse</span></em>); as something whose
essence is rather the determination, affection, modification of an
essence than itself an essence proper, the term <span class="tei tei-q">“essence”</span> designating
properly only a substance: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">accidentis esse est inesse</span></span>.<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249" href="#note_249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a> This
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conception might, no doubt, if pressed too far, be inapplicable to
absolute accidents, like quantity, which are something more than
mere modifications of substance; but it rightly emphasizes the
dependence of the reality of accident on that of substance, the
non-substantial and <span class="tei tei-q">“diminished”</span> character of the <span class="tei tei-q">“accident”</span>-mode
of being; it also helps to show that the <span class="tei tei-q">“inherence”</span> of
accident in substance is a relation—of determining to determinable
being—which is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sui generis</span></span>; and finally it puts us on our
guard against the errors that may be, and have been, committed
by conceiving accidents in the abstract and reasoning about them
apart from their substances, as if they themselves were substances.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This <span class="tei tei-q">“inherence”</span> of accident in substance, this mode of
being whereby it affects, determines or modifies the substance,
differs from accident to accident; these, in fact, are classified
into <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">suprema genera</span></span> by reason of their different ways of affecting
substance (<a href="#Section_60" class="tei tei-ref">60</a>). To this we shall return later. Here we may
inquire, about this general relation of accident to substance,
whether it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> to an accident <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually to inhere in</span></em> a substance,
if not immediately, then at least through the medium of
some other accident. We suggest this latter alternative because
as we shall see presently there are some accidents, such as colour,
taste, shape, which immediately affect the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extension</span></em> of a body,
and only through this the substance of the body itself. Now the
ordinary course of nature never presents us with accidents
except as inhering, mediately or immediately, in a substance.
Nor is it probable that the natural light of our reason would ever
suggest to us the possibility of an exception to this general law.
But the Christian philosopher knows, from Divine Revelation,
that in the Blessed Eucharist the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantity</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extension</span></em> of bread
and wine, together with the taste, colour, form, etc., which affect
this extension, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">remain in existence</span></em> after their connatural substance
of bread and wine has disappeared by transubstantiation. In the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
supernatural order of His providence God preserves these accidents
in existence without a subject; but in this state, though
they do not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually inhere</span></em> in any substance, they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">retain their
natural aptitude and exigence</span></em> for such inherence. The Christian
philosopher, therefore, will not define accident as <span class="tei tei-q">“the mode of
being which inheres in a subject,”</span> but as <span class="tei tei-q">“the mode of being
which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the ordinary course of nature</span></em> inheres in a subject,”</span> or as
<span class="tei tei-q">“the mode of being which has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a natural exigence</span></em> to inhere in a
subject”</span>. It is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual inherence</span></em>, but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural exigence to
inhere</span></em>, that is essential to an accident as such.<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href="#note_250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Furthermore, an accident needs a substance not formally <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qua</span></span>
substance, or as a mode of being naturally existing in itself; it
needs a substance <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a subject</span></em> in which to inhere, which it will in
some way affect, determine, qualify; but the subject in which it
immediately inheres need not always be a substance: it may be
some other accident, in which case both of course will naturally
require some substance as their ultimate basis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Comparing now the concept of accident with that of substance,
we find that the latter is presupposed by the former; that the
latter is prior <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in thought</span></em> to the former; that we conceive accident
as something over and above, something superadded to substance
as subject. For instance, we can define matter and form without
the prior concept of body, or animality and rationality without
the prior concept of man; but we cannot define colour without
the prior concept of body, or the faculty of speech without
the prior concept of man.<a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251" href="#note_251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">251</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Substance, therefore, is prior <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in thought</span></em> to accident; but is
the substance itself also prior <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">temporally</span></em> (prior <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tempore</span></em>) to its
accidents? It is prior in time to some of them, no doubt; the
individual human being is thus prior, for instance, to the knowledge
he may acquire during life. But there is no reason for
saying that a substance must be prior <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in time</span></em> to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> its accidents;<a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252" href="#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a>
so far as we can discover, no created substance comes into
existence devoid of all accidents: corporeal substance devoid of
internal quantity, or spiritual substance devoid of intellect and
will.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If prior in thought, though not necessarily in time, to its
accidents, is a substance prior to its accidents <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ontologically</span></em>
(prior <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natura</span></em>)? Yes; it is the real or ontological
principle of its accidents; it sustains them, and they depend
on it. It is a passive or material cause (using the term <span class="tei tei-q">“material”</span>
in the wide sense, as applicable even to spiritual substances),
or a receptive subject, determined in some way by
them as formal principles. It is at the same time an efficient and
passive cause of some of its own accidents: the soul is an
efficient cause of its own immanent processes of thought and
volition, and at the same time a passive principle of them, undergoing
real change by their occurrence. Of others it is merely a
receptive, determinable subject, of those, namely, which have an
adequate and necessary foundation in its own essence, and which
are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">properties</span></em> in the strict sense: without these it cannot
exist, though they do not constitute its essence, or enter into the
concept of the latter; but it is not prior to them in time, nor is
it the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient cause</span></em> of them; it is, however, a real principle of
them, an essence from the reality of which they necessarily
result, and on which their own reality depends. Such, for instance,
is the faculty of thought, or volition, or speech in regard
to man.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The accident-mode of being is, therefore, a mode of being
which determines a substance in some real way. Its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal effect</span></em>
is to give the substance some real and definite determination:

its causality is that of a formal cause, which consists in its
communicating itself to a subject, and, by its union therewith,
constituting some new reality—in this case a concrete being
endowed with <span class="tei tei-q">“accidental”</span> unity.
</p>

As we have seen already, and as will appear more clearly later

the Infinite Substance has no accidents), is that the created
substance is imperfect, limited in its actual perfection, does not

(<a href="#Section_66" class="tei tei-ref">66</a>) have undoubtedly efficient causes: the various agencies
which produce real but accidental changes in the individual
substances of the universe. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Proper</span></em> accidents, however, inasmuch
as they of necessity exist simultaneously with the substances to
which they belong, and flow from these substances by a necessity
of the very essence of these latter, cannot be said to have any
efficient causes other than those which contribute by their efficiency
to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial changes</span></em> by which these substances are
brought into actual existence; nor can they be said to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">caused
efficiently</span></em> by these substances themselves, but only to <span class="tei tei-q">“flow”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“result”</span> necessarily from the latter, inasmuch as they come into
existence simultaneously with, but dependently on, these substances.
Hence, while substances are universally regarded as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real principles</span></em> of their properties—as, for instance, the soul in
regard to intellect and will, or corporeal substance in regard to
quantity—they are not really efficient causes of their properties,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> they do not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">produce</span></em> these properties by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em>. For these
properties are antecedent to all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em> of the substance; nor can
a created substance <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">act</span></em> by its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essence</span></em>, but only through active
powers, or faculties, or forces, which meditate between the essence
of a created substance and its actions, and which are the proximate
principles of these actions, while the substance or nature is
their remote principle. Hence the <span class="tei tei-q">“properties”</span> which necessarily
result from a substance or nature, have as their efficient
causes the agencies productive of the substance itself.<a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href="#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a>

66. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Main Divisions of Accidents.</span></span>—These considerations
will help us to understand the significance of a few important
divisions of accidents: into proper and common, inseparable and
separable. We shall then be in a position to examine the nature
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the distinction between accidents and substance, and to
establish the existence of accidents really distinct from substance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The attributes which we affirm of substance, other than
the notes constitutive of its essence, are divided into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proper</span></em> accidents,
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">properties</span></em> in the strict sense (ἴδιον, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">proprium</span></span>), and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common</span></em> accidents, or accidents in the more ordinary sense
(συμβεβηκός, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ac-cidens</span></em>). A property is an accident which belongs
exclusively to a certain class or kind of substance, and is found
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></em> in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> members of that class, inasmuch as it has an adequate
foundation in the nature of that substance and a necessary
connexion therewith. Such, for instance, are the faculties of
intellect and will in all spiritual beings; the faculties of speaking,
laughing, weeping in man; the temporal and spatial mode
of being which characterizes all created substances.<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a> When
regarded from the logical point of view, as attributes predicable
of their substances considered as logical subjects, they are distinguished
on the one hand from what constitutes the essence of
this subject (as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></em>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>), but also on the other
hand from those attributes which cannot be seen to have any
absolutely necessary connexion with this subject. The latter
attributes alone are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical accidents</span></em>, the test being the
absence of a necessary connexion in thought with the logical
subject.<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a> But the former class, which are distinguished from
<span class="tei tei-q">“logical”</span> accidents and called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical properties</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">propria</span></span>”</span>) are
none the less <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real accidents</span></em> when considered from the ontological
standpoint; for they do not constitute the essence of the substance;
they are outside the concept of the latter, and super-added—though
necessarily—to it. Whether, however, all or
any of these <span class="tei tei-q">“properties,”</span> which philosophers thus classify as
real or ontological accidents, <span class="tei tei-q">“proper”</span> accidents, of certain
substances, are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> distinct from the concrete, individual substances
to which they belong, or are only aspects of the latter,
<span class="tei tei-q">“substantial modes,”</span> only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">virtually</span></em> distinct in each case from the
individual substance itself,—is another and more difficult question
(<a href="#Section_69" class="tei tei-ref">69</a>). Such a property is certainly not really separable from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its substance; we cannot conceive either to exist really without
the other; though we can by abstraction think, and reason, and
speak, about either apart from the other.<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a> Real inseparability
is, however, regarded by scholastic philosophers as quite
compatible with what they understand by a real distinction (<a href="#Section_38" class="tei tei-ref">38</a>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common</span></em> accident is one which has no such absolutely
necessary connexion with its substance as a <span class="tei tei-q">“property”</span> has; one
which, therefore, can be conceived as absent from the substance
without thereby entailing the destruction of the latter's essence,
or of anything bound up by a necessity of thought with this
essence. And such common accidents are of two kinds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They may be such that in the ordinary course of nature, and
so far as its forces and laws are concerned, they are never found
to be absent from their connatural substances—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inseparable</span></em> accidents.
Thus the colour of the Ethiopian is an inseparable
accident of his human nature as an Ethiopian; he is naturally
black; but if born of Ethiopian parents he would still be an
Ethiopian even if he happened to grow up white instead of black.
We could not, however, conceive an Ethiopian, or any other
human being, existing without the faculties (not the use) of
intellect and will, or the faculty (not the organs, or the actual
exercise of the faculty) of human speech.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Or common accidents may be such that they are sometimes
present in their substances, and sometimes absent—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">separable</span></em> accidents.
These are by far the most numerous class of accidents:
thinking, willing, talking, and actions generally; health or illness;
virtues, vices, acquired habits; rest or motion, temperature,
colour, form, location, etc.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) The next important division of accidents is that into mere
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic denominations</span></em> and intrinsic accidents; the latter being
subdivided into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modal</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> accidents, respectively.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> accident is one which not merely affects its substance
intrinsically, giving the latter an actual determination or
mode of being, of some sort or other, but which has moreover
some entity or reality proper to itself whereby it thus affects the
substance, an entity really distinct from the essence of the substance
thus determined by it. Such, for instance, are all vital
activities of living things;<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a> knowledge, and other acquired
habits; quantity, the fundamental accident whereby corporeal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
substances are all capable of existing extended in space; and
such sensible qualities and energies of matter as heat, colour,
mechanical force, electrical energy, etc. Such, too, according to
many, are intellect, will, and sense faculties in man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are, however, other intrinsic determinations of substance,
other modifications of the latter, which do not seem to involve
any new or additional reality in the substance, over and above
the modification itself. Such, for instance, are motion, rest,
external form or figure, in bodies. These are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modal</span></em> accidents.
They often affect not the substance itself immediately,
but some absolute accident of the latter, and are hence called
<span class="tei tei-q">“accidental modes”</span>. Those enumerated are obviously modes of
the quantity of bodies. Now the appearance or disappearance
of such an accident in a substance undoubtedly involves a real
change in the latter, and not merely in our thought; when a
body moves, or comes to rest, or alters its form, there is a change
in the reality as well as in our thought; and in this sense
these accidents are real and intrinsic to their substances. Yet,
though we cannot say that motion, rest, shape, etc., are really
identical with the body and only mentally distinct aspects of it,
at the same time neither can we say that by their appearance or
disappearance the body gains or loses any reality other than an
accidental determination of itself; whereas it does gain something
more than this when it is heated, or electrified, or increased in
quantity; just as a man who acquires knowledge, or virtue, is
not only really modified, but is modified by real entities which he
has acquired, not having actually possessed them before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, there are accidents which do not affect the substance
intrinsically at all, which do not determine any real change in it,
but merely give it an extrinsic denomination in relation to
something outside it (<a href="#Section_60" class="tei tei-ref">60</a>). Thus, while the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quality</span></em> of heat is an
absolute accident in a body, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em> whereby the latter heats
neighbouring bodies is no new reality in the body itself, and produces
no real change in the latter, but only gives it the extrinsic
denomination of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heating</span></em> in reference to these other bodies in
which the effect really takes place. Similarly the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">location</span></em> of any
corporeal substance in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">space</span></em> or in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em> relatively to others in the
space or time series—its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external</span></em> place (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ubi</span></span>) or time (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quando</span></span>), as
they are called—or the relative position of its parts (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">situs</span></span>) in the
place occupied by it: these do not intrinsically determine it or
confer upon it any intrinsic modification of its substance. Not,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
indeed, that they are mere <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span>, mere logical fictions of
our thought. They are realities, but not realities which affect
the substances denominated from them; they are accidental
modes of other substances, or of the absolute accidents of other
substances. Finally, the accident which we call a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> relation”</span>
presupposes in its subject some absolute accident such as quantity
or quality, or some real and intrinsic change determining these, or
affecting the substance itself; but whether relation is itself a
reality over and above such foundation, is a disputed question.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From these classifications of accidents it will be at once
apparent that the general notion of accident, as a dependent
mode of being, superadded to the essence of a substance and in
some way determining the latter, is realized in widely different
and merely analogical ways in the different ultimate classes of
accidents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Section_67" id="Section_67" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
67. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Real Existence of Accidents. Nature of the
Distinction between Accidents and Substance.</span></span>—It would
be superfluous to prove the general proposition that accidents
really exist. In establishing the real existence of substances we
have seen that the real existence of some accidents at least has
never been seriously denied. These are often called nowadays
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phenomena</span></em>; and philosophers who have denied or doubted the
real existence of substances have been called <span class="tei tei-q">“phenomenists”</span>
simply because they have admitted the real existence only of
these phenomena; though, if they were as logical as Hume they
might have seen with him that such denial, so far from abolishing
substance, could only lead to the substantializing of accidents
(<a href="#Section_63" class="tei tei-ref">63</a>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But while undoubtedly there are realities which <span class="tei tei-q">“exist in
themselves,”</span> such as individual men, animals and plants, there is
no reason for attributing this same mode of existence to entities
such as the thoughts, volitions, emotions, virtues or vices, of the
individual man; or the instinct, hunger, or illness of the dog;
or the colour, perfume, or form of the rose. The concrete
individual man, or dog, or rose, reveals itself to our minds as a
substantial entity, affected with these various accidental entities
which are really distinct from the substantial entity itself and
from one another. Nay, in most of the instances just cited, they
are physically separable from the substantial entity in which they
inhere; not of course in the sense that they could actually exist
without it, but in the sense that it can and does continue to exist
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
actually without them (<a href="#Section_38" class="tei tei-ref">38</a>); for it continues to exist while they
come and go, appear and disappear.<a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href="#note_258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a> Of course the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concrete
individual</span></em> man, or dog, or rose, does not continue to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exist actually
unchanged</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">totally</span></em> identical with itself throughout the change
of accidents (<a href="#Section_64" class="tei tei-ref">64</a>), for the accidents are part of the concrete
individual reality; nay, even the substance itself of the concrete
individual does not remain totally unaffected by the change of
the accidents; because if they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> affect it, as they do, their
change cannot leave it totally unaffected; substance is not at all
a changeless, concrete core, surrounded by an ever-changing
rind or vesture of accidents; or a dark, hidden, immutable and
inscrutable background of a panorama of phenomena (<a href="#Section_64" class="tei tei-ref">64</a>). But
though it is beyond all doubt really affected by the change of its
accidents, it is also beyond all doubt independent of them in
regard to the essential mode of its being, in as much as it exists
and continues to exist in itself throughout all fluctuation of its
accidents; while these on the other hand have only that essentially
dependent mode of being whereby they are actual only by
affecting and determining some subject in which they inhere and
which supports their actuality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The existence, therefore, of some accidents, which are not
only really distinct but even physically separable from their
substances, cannot reasonably be called into question. To deny
the existence of such accidents, or, what comes to the same thing,
their real distinction from substance, is to take up some one of
these three equally untenable positions: that all the changes
which take place within and around us are substantial changes;
or, that there is no such thing as real change, all change being a
mental illusion; or, that contradictory states can be affirmed of
the same reality.<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the nature of the real distinction between accidents and
substance is not in all cases so easy to determine. Nor can we
discuss the question here in reference to each <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">summum genus</span></span> of
accident separately. Deferring to the chapter on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Relation</span></span> the
question of the distinction of this particular accident from substance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the other categories, we may confine our attention
here to the distinction between substance and the three classes
of accidents we have called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic denominations</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modal</span></em> accidents,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> accidents respectively. <span class="tei tei-q">“There are accidents,”</span>
writes Kleutgen,<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“which place nothing and change nothing in the
subject itself, but are ascribed to it by reason of some extrinsic
thing; others, again, produce indeed in the subject itself some
new mode of being, but without their existing in it as a new
reality, distinct from its reality; others, finally, are themselves a
new reality, and have thus a being which is proper to themselves,
though this being is of course dependent on the substance.
These latter alone can be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> distinct from the substance, in
the full sense in which a real distinction is that between thing
and thing. Now Cartesian philosophers have denied that there
are any such accidents as those of the latter class; rejecting the
division of accidents into absolute and modal, they teach that all
accidents are mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modifications</span></em> or determinations of substance,
that they consist solely of various locations and combinations of
the ultimate parts of a substance, or relations of the latter to
other substances.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic denominations</span></em> of a substance do seem on
analysis ultimately to resolve themselves partly into relations of
the latter to other substances, and partly into modal or absolute
accidents of other substances. Hence we may confine our
attention here to the distinction between these two classes of
accident and their connatural substances.

And, approaching this question, it will be well for us to bear two things in
mind. In the first place, our definitions both of substance and of accident are
abstract and generic or universal. But the abstract and universal does not
exist </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">as such</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. The concrete, individual, actually existing substance is never

substance </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">merely</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> a verification of its definition as </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">a being that naturally
inheres in something else</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. In every case what really and actually exists is
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">the individual</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, a being concreted of substance and accidents, a being which

this no matter what sort of distinction we hold to obtain between the substance
and its accidents. This is important; its significance will be better appreciated
according as we examine the distinctions in question. Secondly, as scholastics
understand a real distinction, this can obtain not merely between different

distinct or not (</span><a href="#Section_24" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">24</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">).

if we advert here to their discussion of the question whether or not an

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Those who think that the distinction between essence and existence in
created things is a real distinction, hold that accidents as such have no existence
of their own, that they are actualized by the existence of the substance,
or rather of the concrete, composite individual; that since the latter is a real
unity—not a mere artificial aggregation of entities, but a being naturally
one—it can have only one existence: </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Impossibile est quod unius rei non sit

the substance, as affected and determined by its accidents, is actualized.
They contend that if each of the principles, whether substantial or accidental,
of a concrete individual being had its own existence, their union, no matter
how intimate, could not form a natural unitary being, an individual, but only
an aggregate of such beings. It is neither the matter, nor the form, nor the
corporeal substance apart from its accidents, that exists: it is the substance
completely determined by all its accidents and modes that is the proper subject
of existence.</span><a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> It alone is actualized, and that by </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">one</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> existence, which is
the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">ultimate actuality</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> of the concrete, composite, individual essence: </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">esse
est ultimus actus</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. Hence it is too, they urge, that an accident should be
conceived not properly as </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">a being,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> but only as that whereby a being is
such or such: Accidens non est ens, sed </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">ens entis</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. But it cannot be so conceived
if we attribute to it an existence of its own; for then it would be
</span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">a being</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> in the full and proper sense of the word.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
This is the view of St. Thomas, and of Thomists generally. The arguments
in support of it are serious, but not convincing. And the same may be said
of the reasons adduced for the opposite view: that existence not being really
distinct from essence, accidents in so far as they can be said to have an
essence of their own have likewise an existence of their own.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Supporters of this view not only admit but maintain that the entity of a
real, existing accident is a </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">diminished</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> entity, inasmuch as it is dependent
in a sense in which a really existing substance is not dependent. They simply
deny the Thomist assertion that substantial and accidental principles cannot
combine to form a real and natural unit, an individual being, if each be
accorded an existence appropriate and proportionate to its partial essence;
nor indeed can Thomists </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">prove</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> this assertion. Moreover, if existence be not
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">really</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> distinct from essence, there is no more inconvenience in the claim that
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
partial existences can combine to form one complete existence, </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">unum esse</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
than in the Thomist claim that partial essences, such as substantial and
accidental constitutive principles, can combine to form one complete essence,
one individual subject of existence. Then, furthermore, it is urged that the
substance exists prior </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">in time</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> to some of its accidents; that it is prior </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">in
nature</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> to its properties, which are understood to </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">proceed</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> or </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">flow</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> from it; and
that therefore its existence cannot be theirs, any more than its essence can be
theirs. Finally, it is pointed out that since existence is the actuality of essence,
the existence which actualizes a substance cannot be identical with that which
actualizes an accident. At all events, whether the one existence of the concrete
individual substance as determined by its accidents be as it were a
simple and indivisible existential act, which actualizes the composite individual
subject, as Thomists hold, or whether it be a composite existential act, really
identical with the composite individual subject, as in the other view,</span><a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href="#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> this
concrete existence of the individual is constantly varying with the variation
of the accidents of the individual. This is equally true on either view.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Inquiring into the distinction between substance and its intrinsic
accidents, whether modal or absolute, we have first to
remark that all accidents cannot possibly be reduced to relations;
for if relation itself is something <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em> to the things related, it
must at least presuppose a real and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em> foundation or basis
for itself in the things related. Local motion, for instance, is a
change in the spatial relations of a body to other bodies. But
it cannot be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">merely</span></em> this. For if spatial relations are not mere
subjective or mental fabrications, if they are in any intelligible
sense <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>, then a change in them must involve a change of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something
intrinsic</span></em> to the bodies concerned. Now Descartes, in
denying the existence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> accidents, in reducing all
accidents to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modes</span></em> of substances, understood by modes not any
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em> determinations of substance, but only extrinsic determinations
of the latter. All accidents of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> substance were for
him mere locations, arrangements, dispositions of its extended
parts: extension being its essence. Similarly, all accidents of
spiritual substance were for him mere modalities and mutual relations
of its <span class="tei tei-q">“thought”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“consciousness”</span>: this latter being for
him the essence of spirit. We have here not only the error of
identifying or confounding accidents such as thought and extension
with their connatural substances, spirit and matter, but also
the error of supposing that extrinsic relations and modes of a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
substance, and changes in these, can be real, without there being
in the substances themselves any intrinsic, real, changeable
accidents, which would account for the extrinsic relations and
their changes. If there are no intrinsic accidents, really affecting
and determining substances, and yet really distinct from the
latter, then we must admit either that all change is an illusion
or else that all change is substantial; and this is the dilemma
that really confronts the Cartesian philosophy.

68. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Modal Accidents and the Modal Distinction.</span></span>—The
real distinction which we claim to exist between a substance
and its intrinsic accidents is not the same in all cases: in regard to
some accidents, which we have called intrinsic modes of the substance,
it is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">minor</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modal</span></em> real distinction; in regard to others
which we have called absolute accidents, it is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">major</span></em> real distinction
(<a href="#Section_38" class="tei tei-ref">38</a>). Let us first consider the former.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mode</span></em> has a variety of meanings, some very wide,
some restricted. When one concept determines or limits another
in any way we may call it a mode of the latter. If there is no
real distinction between the determining and the determined
thought-object, the mode is called a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metaphysical</span></em> mode: as
rationality is of animality in man. Again, created things are all
<span class="tei tei-q">“modes”</span> of being; and the various aspects of a creature may
be called <span class="tei tei-q">“modes”</span> of the latter: as <span class="tei tei-q">“finiteness”</span> is a mode of
every created being. We do not use the term in those wide
senses in the present context. Here we understand by a mode
some positive reality which so affects another and distinct reality
as to determine the latter proximately to some definite way of
existing or acting, to which the latter is itself indifferent; without,
however, adding to the latter any new and proper entity other than
the said determination.<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a> Such modes are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> modes.
And some philosophers maintain that there are not only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em>
modes, thus really distinct from the substance, but that there are
even some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em> modes really distinct from the essence of
the substance which they affect: for instance, that the really distinct
constitutive principles of any individual corporeal substance,
matter and form, are actually united only in virtue of a substantial
mode whereby each is ordained for union with the other; or
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subsistence</span></em>, whereby the individual substance is made a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
subsistent and incommunicable <span class="tei tei-q">“person”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“thing,”</span> is a substantial
mode of the individual nature.<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href="#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a> With these latter we
are not concerned here, but only with accidental modes, such as
external shape or figure, local motion, position, action,<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a> etc.
Now when a substance is affected by such accidents as these it
is impossible on the one hand to maintain that they add any
new positive entity of their own to it; they do not seem to have
any reality over and above the determination or modification in
which their very presence in the substance consists. And on the
other hand it cannot be denied that they express some real
predicate which can be affirmed of the substance in virtue of
their presence in it, and that independently of our thought; in other
words it cannot be maintained that they are mere figments or
forms of thought, mere <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span>. If a piece of wax has a
certain definite shape, this shape is inseparable from the wax:
it is nothing except in the wax, for it cannot exist apart from
the wax; but in the wax it is something in some real sense distinct
from the wax, inasmuch as the wax would persist even if it
disappeared. No doubt it is essential to the wax, as extended
in space, to have some shape or other; but it is indifferent to
any particular shape, and hence something distinct from it is required
to remove this indifference. This something is the particular
shape it actually possesses. The shape, therefore, is an
accidental mode of the extension of the wax, a mode which is
really distinct, by a minor real distinction, from this extension
which is its immediate subject.<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> Hence we conclude that there
are accidental modes, or modal accidents, really distinct from
the subjects in which they inhere.

to the distinction between absolute accidents and substance, we
have seen already that separable absolute accidents such as
acquired habits of mind and certain sensible qualities and energies

which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">naturally inseparable</span></em> from their subjects—such
as external quantity or spatial extension or volume is in regard
to the corporeal substance—are also really distinct from their

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But a special difficulty arises in regard to the nature of the
distinction between a substance and its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proper</span></em> accidents,<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> those
which have such an adequate and necessary ground in the essence
of the substance that the latter cannot exist without them: accidents
which are simultaneous with the substance and proceed
necessarily from it, such as the internal quantity of a corporeal
substance, or the intellectual and appetitive powers or faculties
of a spiritual substance. The medieval scholastic philosophers
were by no means unanimous as to the nature of this distinction.
Their discussion of the question centres mainly around the distinction
between the spiritual human soul and its spiritual faculties,
intellect and will, and between these faculties themselves. It is
instructive—as throwing additional light on what they understood
by a real distinction—to find that while Thomists generally
have held that the distinction here in question is a real distinction,
many other scholastics have held that it is only a virtual
distinction, while Scotists have generally taught that it is a formal
distinction (<a href="#Section_35" class="tei tei-ref">35-39</a>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Kleutgen<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a> interprets the formal distinction advocated by
Scotus in the present context as really equivalent to the virtual
distinction. St. Bonaventure, after referring to the latter distinction,
and to the real distinction propounded by St. Thomas,
adopts himself an intermediate view: that the faculties of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
soul are indeed really distinct from one another, but nevertheless
are not really distinct, as accidental entities, from the substance
of the soul itself. We see how this can be by considering that
the material and formal principles which constitute a corporeal
substance, though really distinct from each other, are not really
distinct from the substance itself. They are not accidents of
the latter but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">constitute</span></em> its essence, and so are to be referred <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">reductivé</span></span>
to the category of substance. So, by analogy, the faculties
of the soul, though really distinct from each other, do not belong
to any accidental category really distinct from the substance of
the soul, but belong <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">reductivé</span></span> to the latter category, not indeed as
constituting, but as flowing immediately and necessarily from, the
substance of the soul itself.<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href="#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a> And, like St. Thomas, he finds the
ultimate source and explanation of this multiplicity of faculties
and forces <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the finiteness</span></em> of the created substance as such.<a id="noteref_272" name="noteref_272" href="#note_272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">272</span></span></a>
But St. Thomas went farther than St. Bonaventure, for he taught—as
indeed Thomists generally teach, and many who are not
Thomists—that the faculties of the human soul are really distinct
from one another, not merely as proximate principles of really
distinct vital acts, but as accidental entities or essences; and
that as such they are really distinct from the essence or substance
itself of the human soul. The arguments in favour of this view
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will be given in their proper place in connexion with the category
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quality</span></em>. If they are not demonstrative in their force, they are
certainly such that the view for which they make is very highly
probable; but we are concerned here to show, in this concluding
section, that the recognition of a real distinction in general between
substance and its accidents does not in any way compromise
the real unity of the concrete individual being. It has been
widely accused of doing so by philosophers who try to discredit
this view without fully understanding it. This characteristically
modern attitude is illustrated by the persistent attempts that
have been made in recent times to throw ridicule on what they
describe as the <span class="tei tei-q">“faculty psychology”</span>.<a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273" href="#note_273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">273</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The source of this groundless charge lies partly in the mistaken
conception of accident and substance as concrete entities
superadded the one to the other; partly in the mistaken notion
that the union of substance and accidents cannot result in a real
unity, that there cannot be more or less perfect grades of real
unity (<a href="#Section_27" class="tei tei-ref">27</a>); and partly in the false assumption that real distinction
always implies mutual separability of concrete entities. Of
these errors we need only refer to that concerning unity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Modern philosophers not uncommonly conceive the union of
substance and accidents as being necessarily a mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mechanical</span></em>
union or aggregation, and oppose it to <span class="tei tei-q">“organic”</span> unity which
they regard as a real unity involving the richness of an energetic,
<span class="tei tei-q">“living”</span> multiplicity. This involves a misrepresentation of the
traditional scholastic view. The union of substance and accident
is not a mechanical union. Nothing could be farther from the
minds of the scholastic interpreters of Aristotle than the conception
of the ultimate principles of the universe of our experience
as inert entities moved according to purely mechanical laws; or
of the individual concrete being as a mere machine, or a mere
aggregate of mechanical elements. They recognized even in the
individual inorganic substance an internal, unifying, active and
directive principle of all the energies and activities of the thing—its
substantial form. And if this is all those philosophers
mean by the metaphorical transference of the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“organic
unity,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“internal living principle of development,”</span> etc., to the
mineral world, they are so far in accord with the traditional
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scholastic philosophy;<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href="#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a> while if they mean that all substances
are principles of <span class="tei tei-q">“vital”</span> energy, or that all reality is one organic
unity, in the literal sense of these terms, they are committing
themselves either to the palpably false theory of pan-psychism,
or to the gratuitous reassertion of a very old and very crude
form of monism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By <span class="tei tei-q">“organic”</span> unity we understand the unity of any living
organism, a unity which is much more perfect than that of the
parts of a machine, or than any natural juxtaposition of material
parts in an inorganic whole; for the organs, though distinct in
number and in nature from one another, are united by an internal
principle to form one living individual, so that if any organ were
separated from the living organism it would cease to be an organ.<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href="#note_275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">275</span></span></a>
But organic unity is not by any means the most perfect kind of
unity conceivable.<a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a> The living organism exists and develops
and attains to the perfection of its being only through a
multiplicity of integral parts extended in space. The spiritual
substance is subject to no such dispersion of its being. From its
union with the faculties whereby it attains to its natural development,
there results a real unity of a higher order than that of any
organism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And nevertheless, even though the unity of the concrete
spiritual substance and its faculties be so far higher than a
mechanical or even an organic unity, it is not perfect. Even
though the faculties of the soul be determinations of its substance,
even though they flow from it as actualities demanded
by its essence for the normal and natural development of its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
being, still it is a complete subsisting essence of its kind without
them; it possesses its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> perfection without them,
so that however intimate be their union with it they can never
form one essence with it; it needs them only for the fuller
development of its being by acquiring further <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intermediate</span></em> perfections
and thus attaining to its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> perfection (<a href="#Section_46" class="tei tei-ref">46</a>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And here we touch on the most fundamental ground of the
distinction, in all created things, between their substance and
their accidental perfections. Unlike the Necessary, Absolute
Being, whose infinite perfection is the eternal actuality of His
essence, no creature possesses the actuality of its being <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tota simul</span></span>,
but only by a progressive development whereby it gradually
acquires really new intermediate and final perfections, really
distinct from, though naturally due to, its essence. Hence, even
though some of its accidents—properties such as the powers and
faculties we have been discussing—be not really distinct from
the essence wherewith they are necessarily connected, this is not
true of its acquired habits and dispositions, or of the activities
which proceed from these latter as their proximate principles.
At the same time the concrete being is, at every moment of its
existence and development, a real unity, but a unity which, involving
in itself as it does a real multiplicity of distinct principles,
must ever fall infinitely short of the perfect type of real unity—that
realized only in the Self-Existent, Necessary Being.

We must next examine the category of substance more in detail,
terminating as it does in the important concept of personality or
person. This latter conception is one which must have its origin
for all philosophers in the study of the human individual, but which,
for scholastic philosophers, is completed and perfected by the light
of Christian Revelation. We shall endeavour to show in the first
place what can be gathered from the light of reason about the
constitution of personality, and also briefly to note how Christian
Revelation has increased our insight into the perfections involved
in it. As leading up to the concept of person, we must set forth
certain divisions or classifications of substance: into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> substances, and into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">complete</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incomplete</span></em> substances.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The specific and generic natures of substantial entities do
not inhere, like accidents, in individual substances; they constitute
the essence of the latter, and hence these <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universals</span></em> are called
substances. But the universal as such does not really exist;
it is realized only in individuals; in the logical order it pre-supposes
the individual as a logical subject of which it is affirmed,
a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">subjectum attributionis seu praedicationis</span></span>. Hence it is called a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> substance, while the individual substance is called a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em>
substance. Of course we can predicate attributes of universal
substances, and use these as logical subjects, as when we say
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Man</span></em> is mortal”</span>. But such propositions have no real meaning,
and give us no information about reality, except in so far as we
can refer their predicates (<span class="tei tei-q">“mortal”</span>), through the medium of
their universal subjects (<span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span>), back ultimately to the individual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
substances (John, James, etc.) which alone are real, and in which
alone the universal (<span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span>) has its reality. Hence the individual
is, in the logical order, the ultimate and fundamental subject
of all our predications. And furthermore, the individual
substance cannot be used as a logical predicate of anything underlying
itself, while the universal substance can be so used in
relation to the individual.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the ontological order, of course, the universal substance is
individualized, and, as individual, it is the subject in which all
accidents inhere, their <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">subjectum inhaesionis</span></span>: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> subject of
many of them, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">remote</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ultimate</span></em> subject of those of
them which inhere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediately</span></em> in other accidents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus while in the ontological order all substances, whether
we think of them as universal or as individual, are the ultimate
subjects of inhesion for all real accidents, in the logical order it
is only the individual substance that is the ultimate subject of
attribution for all logical predicates. Hence it was that the individual
substance (τόδε τί ὄν), vindicating for itself more fully
the rôle of subject, was called by Aristotle οὐσία πρώτη,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">substantia prima</span></span>, while he called the universal, specific or generic
substance, οὐσία δεύτερα, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">substantia secunda</span></span>.<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a> These are, of
course, two ways of regarding substance, and not two really distinct
species of substance as genus. The distinction between the

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) The divisions of substance into spiritual and corporeal, of
the latter into inorganic and organic, of these again into vegetative
and animal, and finally of animal substances into brute animals
and human beings,—offer no special difficulties. All purely
natural or rational knowledge of the possibility and nature of
purely spiritual substances is based on the analogy of our knowledge
of the human soul, which, though a spiritual substance, is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not a pure spirit, but is naturally allied with matter in its mode of
existence. The individual human being offers to human experience
the sole example of the sufficiently mysterious conjunction
and combination of matter and spirit, of the corporeal mode
of being and the spiritual mode of being, to form one composite
substance, partly corporeal and partly spiritual.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) This in turn suggests the division of substances into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simple</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">composite</span></em>. The latter are those which we understand to be
constituted by the natural and substantial union of two really
distinct but incomplete substantial principles, a formative, determining,
specifying principle, and a material, determinable, indifferent
principle: such are all corporeal substances whether inorganic,
vegetative, sentient, or rational. The former, or simple
substances, are those which we understand to be constituted by
a sole and single substantial principle which determines and
specifies their essence, without the conjunction of any material,
determinable principle. We have no direct and immediate experience
of any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">complete</span></em> created substance of this kind; but each
of us has such direct experience of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incomplete</span></em> simple substance,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> his own soul; while we can infer from our experience the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existence</span></em> of other incomplete simple substances, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the formative

complete simple substances as pure spirits, and the actual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existence</span></em>
of the perfectly simple, uncreated substance of the Infinite
Being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) If there are such things as composite substances, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
substances constituted by the substantial union of two really
distinct principles, then it follows that while the composite
substance itself is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">complete</span></em>, each of its substantial constitutive
principles is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incomplete</span></em>. Of course there are many philosophers
nowadays who reject as mere mental fictions, as products of
mere logical distinctions, and as devoid of objective validity, the
notions of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">composite</span></em> substance and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incomplete</span></em> substance. Nor is
this to be wondered at when we remember what a variety of
groundless and gratuitous notions are current in regard to
substance itself (<a href="#Section_64" class="tei tei-ref">64</a>). But understanding substance in the traditional
sense already explained (<a href="#Section_62" class="tei tei-ref">62</a>), there is nothing whatever
inconsistent in the notion of a composite substance, or of an
incomplete substance,—provided these notions are understood in
the sense to be explained presently. Nay, more, not only are
these notions intrinsically possible: we must even hold them to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be objectively valid and real, to be truly expressive of the nature
of reality, unless we are prepared to hold that there is no such
thing as substantial change in the universe, and that man himself
is a mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aggregate</span></em> of material atoms moved according to mechanical
laws and inhabited by a conscious soul, or thinking
principle, rather than an individual being with one definite
substantial nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What, then, are we to understand by complete and incomplete
substances respectively? A substance is regarded as complete
in the fullest sense when it is wanting in no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em> principle
without which it would be incapable of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existing</span></em> and discharging
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> its functions in the actual order as an individual of some
definite species. Of course no created substance exists or discharges
its functions unless it is endowed with some accidents,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> with properties, faculties, forces, etc. But there is no question
of these here. We are considering only the essential perfections
of the substance. Thus, then, any existing individual of
any species—a man, a horse, an oak—is a complete substance in
this fullest sense. It is complete <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the line of substance</span></em>, in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em> perfection, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in ordine substantialitatis</span></span>,”</span> inasmuch as
it can exist (and does actually exist) without being conjoined or
united substantially with any other substance to form a composite
substance other than itself. And it is complete <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the line of
specific perfection</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in ordine speciei</span></span>,”</span> because not only can it exist
without such conjunction with any other substantial principle, but
it can discharge <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the functions natural to its species, and thus
tend towards its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> perfection (<a href="#Section_47" class="tei tei-ref">47</a>) without such conjunction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is conceivable that a substance might be complete in
the line of substantial perfections, and thus be capable of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existing</span></em>
in the actual order and discharging there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> of the functions of
its species without conjunction with any other substantial principle,
and yet be incapable of discharging <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the functions
natural to an individual of its species without conjunction with
some other substantial principle, in which case it would be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incomplete</span></em>
in the line of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specific</span></em> perfection, though complete in
everything pertaining to its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantiality</span></em>. We know of one
such substance,—the human soul. Being spiritual and immortal,
it can exist apart from the body to which it is united by nature,
and in this separated condition retain and exercise its spiritual
faculties of intellect and will; it is therefore complete as regards
the distinctively substantial perfection whereby it is <span class="tei tei-q">“capable of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
existing in itself”</span>. But being of its nature destined for union
with a material principle, constituting an individual of the human
species only by means of such union, and being capable of discharging
some of the functions of this species, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the sentient
and vegetative functions, only when so united, it has not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the
perfections of its species independently of the body; and it is
therefore an incomplete substance in the line of specific perfections,
though complete in those essential to its substantiality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, if it be true that just as man is composed of two
substantial principles, soul and body, so every living thing is
composed of a substantial vital principle and a substantial
material principle, and that every inorganic individual thing is
likewise composed of two really distinct substantial principles, a
formative and a passive or material principle; and if, furthermore,
it be true that apart from the spiritual principle in man every other
vital or formative principle of the composite <span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span> of our
experience is of such a nature that it cannot actually exist except
in union with some material principle, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>,—then it
follows necessarily that all such substantial principles of these
complete composite substances are themselves <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incomplete</span></em> substances:
and incomplete not only in regard to perfections which
would make them subsisting individuals of a species, but (unlike
the human soul) incomplete even in the line of substantiality
itself, inasmuch as no one of them is capable of actually existing
at all except in union with its connatural and correlative
principle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we arrive at the notion of substances that are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incomplete</span></em>
in the line of specific perfections, or in that of substantial perfections,
or even in both lines. An incomplete substance, therefore,
is not one which verifies the definition of substance only in
part. The incomplete substance <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fully</span></em> verifies the definition of a
substance.<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a> It is conjoined, no doubt, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with another</span></em> to form a
complete substance; but it does not exist <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the other</span></em>, or in the
composite substance, as accidents do. It is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a substantial</span></em> principle
of the composite substance, not an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em> determination of
the latter, or of the other substantial principle with which it is
conjoined. It thus verifies the notion of substance as a mode of
being which naturally exists in itself; and united with its correlative
substantial principle it discharges the function of supporting
all accidental determinations which affect the composite substantial
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
essence. Since, however, it does not exist itself independently
as an individual of a species, but only forms the
complete individual substance by union with its correlative substantial
principle, it may be, and has been, accurately described
as not belonging to the category of substance <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em>, but only
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">referentially</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">reductivé</span></span>”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The concepts of composite substance, of complete and incomplete
substances, understood as we have just explained them, are
therefore perfectly intelligible in themselves. And this is all we
are concerned to show in the present context. This is not the
place to establish the theses of psychology and cosmology from
which they are borrowed. That the human soul is spiritual and
immortal; that its union with a really distinct material principle
to form the individual human substance or nature is a substantial
union; that all living organisms and all inorganic bodies
are really composite substances and subject to substantial
change: these various theses of scholastic philosophy we here
assume to be true. And if they are true the conception of incomplete
substances naturally united to form a complete composite
substance is not only intelligible as an hypothesis but is
objectively true and valid as a thesis; and thus the notion of an
incomplete substance is not only a consistent and legitimate
notion, but is also a notion which gives mental expression to an
objective reality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may add this consideration: The concept of an accident
really distinct from its substance involves no intrinsic repugnance.
Yet an accident is a mode of being which is so weak
and wanting in reality, if we may speak in such terms, that it
cannot naturally exist except by inhering, mediately or immediately,
in the stronger and more real mode of being which is substance.
But an incomplete substance is a higher grade of reality
than any accident. Therefore if accidents can be real, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a fortiori</span></span>
incomplete substances can be real.

thing be a substance, an accident, or a concrete existing individual
including substance and accidents.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and scholastic philosophy is unmistakable. It means the essence
or substance of an individual person or thing, regarded as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
fundamental principle of the latter's activities</span></em>. Every finite individual
comes into existence incomplete, having no doubt its
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> perfections and properties <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em>, but its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intermediate</span></em>

gradually, through the exercise of its connatural activities.
Every being is essentially intended for activity of some sort:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Omne ens est propter suam operationem,”</span> says St. Thomas.
And by the constant interplay of their activities these beings
realize and sustain the universal order which makes the world a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>. There is in all things an immanent purpose or finality
which enables us to speak of the whole system which they form

as no one of them separately is an adequate intrinsic principle of all the
functions which it can discharge, and is naturally destined to discharge, by
its natural union with the others, whereas there results from their union a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">

there is no ground for admitting the existence of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">incomplete substances</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, there
is ground for distinguishing between </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">complete and incomplete natures</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">; (</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">b</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">)
the view that from the union or conjunction of an actual multiplicity of substances,

there </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">does</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> arise such a nature whenever the component substances not
merely co-operate to discharge certain functions which none of them could
discharge separately (which indeed is true of an accidental union, as of two
horses drawing a load which neither could draw by itself), but when they unite
in a more permanent and intimate way according to what we call </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">natural
laws</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> or </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">laws of nature,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> so as to form a new fundamental principle of

that certain facts brought to light by the physical and biological sciences
in modern times afford strong evidence that the elementary material constituents
of bodies, whether inorganic or living, remain </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">substantially unaltered</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
while combining to form the multitudinous </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">natural kinds</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> or </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">natures</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of those
living or non-living material things. It was to reconcile this supposed </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">plurality</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actually distinct</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> and </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">diverse</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> substances in the individual with the
indubitable </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">real unity</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of the latter, that these philosophers distinguished
between substance and nature. But it is not clear that the facts alleged
afford any such evidence. Of course if the philosopher approaches the consideration
of it with what we may call the atomic preconception of material
substances as permanent, unchangeable entities, this view will preclude all
recognition of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">substantial</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> change in the universe; it will therefore force him
to conclude that each individual, composite agent has a unity which must be
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">less</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> than substantial, and which, because he feels it to be </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">more</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> than a mere
accidental or artificial unity, he will describe as </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">natural</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, as a union to form
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">one nature</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. But if he approach the evidence in question with the view that
substantial change is possible, this view, involving the recognition of incomplete
substances as real, will remove all necessity for distinguishing between
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
substance and nature, and will enable him to conclude that however various
and manifold be the activities of the individual, their co-ordination and unification,
as proceeding from the individual, point to a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">substantial</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> unity in the
latter as their fundamental principle, a unity resulting from the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">union of incomplete
substances</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
This latter is undoubtedly the view of St. Thomas, of practically all the
medieval scholastics, and of most scholastics in modern times. Nor do we
see any sufficient reason for receding from it, or admitting the modern distinction
between substance and nature. And if it be objected that the view
which admits the reality of incomplete substances and substantial change is
as much a preconception as what we have called the atomic view of substance,
our answer is, once more, that since we have no intellectual intuition into the
real constitution of the substances which constitute the universe, since we can
argue to this only by observing and reasoning from their activities on the
principle </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Operari requitur esse</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, the evidence alone must decide which view of
these substances is the correct one. Does the evidence afforded us by a
scientific analysis of all the functions, inorganic, vegetative, sentient and
rational, of an individual man, forbid us to conclude that he is one complete
substance, resulting from the union of two incomplete substantial principles,
a spiritual soul and a material principle? and at the same time compel us to
infer that he is one complete nature resulting from the union of a plurality of
principles supposed to be complete as substances and incomplete as natures?
We believe that it does not; nor can we see that any really useful purpose is
served by thus setting up a real distinction between substance and nature.
From the evidence to hand it is neither more nor less difficult to infer unity of
substance than unity of nature in the individual. The inference in question
is an inference from facts in the phenomenal order, in the domain of the senses,
to what must be actually there in the noumenal order, in the domain of
nature or substance, a domain which cannot be reached by the senses but
only by intellect. Nor will any imagination images which picture for us the
physical fusion or coalescence of material things in the domain of the senses
help us in the least to conceive in any positive way the mode in which incomplete
natures or substances unite to form a complete nature or substance.
For these latter facts belong to the domain which the senses cannot reach at
all, and which intellect can reach only inferentially and not by direct
insight.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Hence we consider the view which regards real unity of nature as compatible
with real and actual plurality of complete substances in the individual, as
improbable. At the same time we do not believe that this view is a necessary
corollary from the real identification of essence with existence in created
things. We have seen that even if accidents have their own existence in so far
as they have their own essence—as they have if essence and existence be really
identical—nevertheless the concrete substance as determined by its accidents
can have a really unitary existence, </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">unum esse</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> corresponding to and identical
with its composite constitution (</span><a href="#Section_67" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">67</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">). Similarly, if the existence of each incomplete
substance is identical with its incomplete essence, this is no obstacle
to the complete substance—which results from the union of two such incomplete
substantial principles—having one complete unitary existence identical
with its composite essence. Hence it is useless to argue against the view that
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
a plurality of actually distinct and complete substances can unite to form a
complete nature which will be really </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">one being</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, on the ground that each
complete substance has already its own existence and that things which have
and preserve their own existence cannot form </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">one being</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. Such an argument
is inconclusive; for although </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">one being</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> has of course only one existence, it
has not been proved that this one existence cannot result from the union of
many incomplete existences: especially if these existences be identical with
the incomplete essences which are admittedly capable of uniting to form one
complete essence.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
It may, however, be reasonably urged against the opinion under criticism
that, since the complete substances are supposed to remain complete and
unchanged in their state of combination, it is difficult to see how this combination
can be a real union and not merely an extrinsic juxtaposition,—one
which remains in reality a merely accidental conjunction, even though we
may dignify it with the title of a </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">natural union</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
And finally it may be pointed out that in this view the operations of the
individual have not really </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">one ultimate</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> intrinsic principle at all, since behind
the supposed unity of nature there is a more fundamental plurality of
actually distinct substances.

72. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Subsistence and Personality.</span></span>—We have already
examined the relation between the individual and the universal,
between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> substances, in connexion with the
doctrine of Individuation (<a href="#Section_31" class="tei tei-ref">31-3</a>). And we then saw that whatever
it be that individuates the universal nature, it is at all events
not to be regarded as anything extrinsic and superadded to this
nature in the individual, as anything really distinct from this
nature: that, for instance, what makes Plato's human nature to be
Plato's is not anything really distinct from the human nature
that is in Plato. We have now to fix our attention on the nature
as individualized. We have to consider the complete individual
nature or substance itself in actually existing individual <span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span>
or <span class="tei tei-q">“persons”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must remember that scholastics are not agreed as to
whether there is a real distinction or only a virtual distinction
between the actual existence and the complete individual essence
or substance or nature of created individual beings (<a href="#Section_21" class="tei tei-ref">21-4</a>).
Furthermore we have seen that philosophers who study the metaphysics
of the inorganic world and of the lower forms of life are
unable to say with certainty what is the individual in these
domains: whether it is the chemical molecule or the chemical
atom or the electron; whether it is the single living cell or the
living mass consisting of a plurality of such cells (<a href="#Section_31" class="tei tei-ref">31</a>). But we
have also seen that as we ascend the scale of living things all

man, a horse, an oak tree, are undoubtedly individual beings.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bearing these things in mind we have now to inquire into
what has been called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subsistence</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personality</span></em> of the complete
individual substance or nature: that perfection which enables

<span class="tei tei-q">“person”</span>. By personality we mean the subsistence of a complete
individual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rational</span></em> nature. We shall therefore inquire into the
meaning of the generic term <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">subsistentia</span></span> (or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">suppositalitas</span></span>), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subsistence</span></em>,
in the abstract. But let us look at it first in the concrete.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A complete individual nature or substance, when it exists in
the actual order, really distinct and separate in its own complete
entity from every other existing being, exercising its powers and
discharging its functions of its own right and according to the
laws of its own being, is said to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subsist</span></em>, or to have the perfection
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subsistence</span></em>. In this state it not only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exists in itself</span></em> as every
substance does; it is not only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incommunicable</span></em> to any other
being as every individual is, in contradistinction with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universal</span></em> substances which are, as such, indefinitely communicable
to individuals; but it is also a complete whole, incommunicable
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a mere integral or essential part</span></em> to some other whole,
unlike the incomplete substantial constituents, or integral parts,
members or organs of, say, an individual organic body; and
finally it is incommunicable in the sense that it is not capable of
being assumed into the subsisting unity of some other superior
<span class="tei tei-q">“suppositum”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“person”</span>. All those characteristics we find
in the individual <span class="tei tei-q">“subsisting thing”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“person”</span>. It <span class="tei tei-q">“exists
in itself”</span> and is not communicable to another substance <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as an
accident</span></em>, because it is itself a substance. It is not communicable
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to individuals as a universal</span></em>, because it is itself an individual. It
is not communicable <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as an integral or essential part to a whole</span></em>,

is not communicable to, and cannot be assumed into, the unity of

a higher personality so as to subsist by virtue of the latter's
subsistence, because it has a perfection incompatible with such
assumption, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> its own proper subsistence, whereby it is already
an actually subsisting thing or person in its own right, or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sui

The mention of this last sort of incommunicability would be superfluous,
and indeed unintelligible, did we not know from Divine Revelation that the
human nature of our Divine Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, though it is a
complete and most perfect individual nature, is nevertheless </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">not a person</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">,

Person, subsists by virtue of the Divine Subsistence of the latter.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We see, therefore, what subsistence does for a complete
individual nature in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">static</span></em> order. It makes this nature <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sui
juris</span></span>, incommunicable, and entirely independent in the mode of
its actual being: leaving untouched, of course, the essential
dependence of the created <span class="tei tei-q">“subsisting thing”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“person”</span> on
the Creator. In the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dynamic</span></em> order, the order of activity and
development, subsistence makes the complete individual nature
not only the ultimate principle <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by which</span></em> all the functions of the
individual are discharged, but also the ultimate principle or
agent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em> exercises these functions: while the nature <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as such</span></em>

individual nature are always ascribed and attributed to the latter
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as subsisting</span></em>, to the <span class="tei tei-q">“subsisting thing”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“person”</span>. In regard
to an individual human person, for instance, whether his intellect
thinks, or his will resolves, or his imagination pictures things, or
his eyes see, or his hand writes, or his stomach digests, or his
lungs breathe, or his head aches, it is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">person</span></em>, properly,
that discharges or suffers all these functions, though by
means of different faculties, organs and members; and it is to
him properly that we ascribe all of them.<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a>

Now the individual human person is neither his soul, nor his

human soul itself, whether we consider it as united to the material

Furthermore, even though an individual nature be complete as a nature,
endowed with all the substantial and specific perfections which constitute it a
complete individual of the species to which it belongs, nevertheless if it is
assumed into the personality of another and higher nature, and subsists in
personal union with the latter and by virtue of the latter's subsistence, then
that nature, not having its own proper and connatural subsistence, is not itself
a person. Nor can the actions which are elicited by means of it be ascribed
ultimately to it; they must be ascribed to the person by whose subsistence
it subsists and into whose personality it has been assumed. If an individual
human nature be thus hypostatically or personally assumed into, and united
with, a higher Divine Personality, and subsists only by this Personality, such
a human nature will be really and truly an individual nature of the human
species; the actions elicited through it and performed by means of it will be
really and truly human actions; but it will not be a human person; while its
actions will be really and truly the actions of the Divine Person, and will
therefore be also really and truly divine: they will be the actions of the
God-Man, divine and human, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">theandric</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. All this we know only from Divine
Revelation concerning the hypostatic union of the human nature of Christ
with the Person of the Divine Word; nor could we know it otherwise. But
all this does not modify, it only supplements and completes, what the light of
reason discloses to us regarding the subsistence or personality of any complete
individual nature.

now what we mean by the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“subsistence,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“suppositum,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“person,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“personality,”</span> we have next to inquire
in what precisely does subsistence consist. What is it that
constitutes a complete individual nature a <span class="tei tei-q">“subsisting being,”</span> or
if the nature be rational, a <span class="tei tei-q">“person”</span>? Subsistence connotes,
over and above the mode of <span class="tei tei-q">“existing in itself”</span> which
characterizes all substance, the notion that the substance or
nature is individual, that it is complete, that it is in every way
incommunicable, that it is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sui juris</span></span> or autonomous in its
existence and activities. These notions are all positive; they
imply positive perfections: even incommunicability is really a
positive perfection though the term is negative. But is any one
of the positive perfections, thus contained in the notion of subsistence,
a positive something <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">over and above</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really distinct

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some of those philosophers who regard the distinction between
essence and existence in creatures as a real distinction,
identify the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subsistence</span></em> of the complete individual nature with its
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual existence</span></em>, thus placing a real distinction between nature

is not likely that any philosophers, guided by the light of reason
alone, would ever have held, or even suspected, that the subsistence
of an actually existing individual nature is a positive
perfection really distinct from, and superadded to, the latter.
For we never, in our natural experience, encounter an existing
individual substance, or nature, or agent, that is not distinct,
autonomous, independent, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sui juris</span></span>, and incommunicable in its
mode of being and acting.

The principal difficulty against this view is a theological difficulty. As
formulated by Urraburu,</span><a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> it appears to involve an ambiguity in the expression

individual nature adds no positive perfection to the latter, so that the
latter necessarily subsists and is a person unless it is actually assumed into a
higher personality, and by the very fact that it is not actually so assumed,
then the human nature of Christ </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">is as complete in every way and in every
line of substantial perfection, by virtue of its own proper entity, when actually
united with the Divine Person, as it would be were it not so united, or as
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
the person of Peter, or Paul, or any other human person is</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. But this implies
that there are in Christ </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">two substances complete in every respect</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.
Now between two such substances </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">there cannot be a substantial union,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">
a union which would constitute </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">one being,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">unum per se ens</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to the more common view of catholic philosophers
(and theologians) subsistence is some positive perfection really
distinct from the complete individual nature. But the supporters
of this general view explain it in different ways. We have already
referred to the view of certain Thomists who, identifying
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subsistence</span></em> with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual existence</span></em> of the complete substance or
nature, place a real distinction between the existence and the substance
or nature. Other Thomists, while defending the latter distinction,
point out that actual existence confers no real perfection,

is not existence, but is rather a perfection of the real, essential, or
substantial order, as distinct from the existential order—a perfection
presupposed by actual existence, and whose proper function
is to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unify</span></em> all the substantial constituents and accidental determinations
of the individual substance or nature, thus making it a
really unitary being—<span class="tei tei-q">“unum ens per se”</span>—proximately capable
of being actualized by the simple existential act: which latter
is the ultimate actuality of the real being: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse est ultimus actus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a>

The concrete individual nature, containing as it does a plurality
of really distinct principles, substantial and accidental, needs
some unifying principle to make these one incommunicable reality,

substantial and accidental principles in the concrete individual
nature would have its own existence: so that the result would be

Of those who deny that the distinction between the existence
and the essence of any created nature is a real distinction, some
hold in the present matter the Scotist view that subsistence is not
a positive perfection really distinct from the complete individual
nature. Others, however, hold what we have ventured to regard
as the more common view: that personality is something positive
and really distinct from nature. But they explain what they
conceive subsistence to be without any reference to existence,
and without distinguishing between the essential and the existential
order of reality.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most common explanation seems to be that subsistence
is a unifying principle of the concrete individual nature, as stated
above. Thus conceived, it is not an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> reality; nor is the
distinction between it and the nature a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">major</span></em> real distinction. It
is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial mode</span></em> (<a href="#Section_68" class="tei tei-ref">68</a>), naturally superadded to the substance
and modally distinct from the latter. It so completes and determines
the substance or nature that the latter not only exists in itself

which an accidental mode such as a definite shape or
location gives to the accident of quantity.<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a>

This mode is absent (supernaturally) from the human nature of our Divine
Lord; this nature is therefore communicable; and the Personality of the
Divine Word supernaturally supplies the function of this absent natural

It must be confessed that it is not easy to understand how
this or any other <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em> mode can be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> distinct from the
substance it modifies. And in truth the distinction is not real in
the full sense: it is not between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing</span></em>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">inter rem et rem</span></span>.
All that is claimed for it is that it is not merely mental; that it is
not merely an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span> which the mind projects into the reality;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that it is a positive perfection of the nature or substance, a perfection
which, though naturally inseparable from the latter, is not
absolutely inseparable, and which, therefore, is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> supernaturally
absent from the human nature and replaced by the Divine
Personality in the case of the hypostatic union.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It belongs, moreover, to the order of substance, not to that
of accidents: the substantial mode differs from the accidental
mode, or modal accident, in this, that it gives to the substance
some ultimate determining perfection which appertains to the
substance as such, and whereby the substance is completed in the
order of <span class="tei tei-q">“existing in itself”</span>. Subsistence is not an accident, even
though it supervenes on the complete nature, for it determines the
substance of the latter, not in relation to any line of accidental
activity, as a power or faculty, nor as something modifying it accidentally,
but as a mode which ultimately determines and perfects
it in the order of substantial reality itself, in the order of <span class="tei tei-q">“existing
in itself”</span> in such a full and perfect manner as to be <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sui juris</span></span> and
incommunicable.

The main difficulty against this view is also theological: If subsistence
is a positive perfection it either belongs to the complete individual nature or
it does not; in the former case the humanity of Christ, assumed by the Divine
Word, was not a complete human nature; in the latter case the individual
human nature can exist without it: and both consequences are equally inadmissable.
But it may be replied that, granting the first member of the
disjunctive, the consequence inferred from it does not really follow: subsistence
belongs to the complete individual nature as an ultimate natural complement;
but when it is absent and supplied supernaturally by the Divine Personality
the nature is still complete as a nature: it is wanting in no absolute or entitative
perfection, but only in a modality which is supereminently supplied by
the Divine Personality. Neither is the consequence from the second member
of the disjunctive a valid inference. For though personality as a mode does
not belong to the essence of an individual human nature, no such individual
nature can exist without </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">some</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> personality, either its own or another: just as
extension cannot exist without </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">some</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> shape, though any particular shape is not
essential to it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To sum up, then, the doctrine of the two preceding sections:
What are we to understand by a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">person</span></em>, and by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personality</span></em>?
Unquestionably our conception of person and personality (concrete
and abstract) is mainly determined, and very rightly so, by
an analysis of what constitutes the actually existing individual
of the human species. Whatever our concept be, it must certainly
be realized and verified in all human individuals: these, before all
other beings, must be included in the denotation of our concept
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of person. In fact, for the philosopher, guided by the natural
light of reason alone, the term can have hardly any other connotation.
He will, no doubt, ascribe personality, as the highest
mode of being he knows of, to the Supreme Being; but he will
here ascribe it only in an analogical and supereminent way;
and only from Divine Revelation can he know that this Supreme
Being has not a single but a threefold Personality. Again, his
consideration of the nature of the human soul as an embodied
substance which is nevertheless spiritual and immortal will enable
him to affirm the possibility of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purely spiritual</span></em> created beings;
and these he will of course conceive as persons. But, conceiving
the human soul itself as a constituent principle of the human
individual, he will not conceive the soul itself as a person.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The philosopher who understands the traditional Aristotelian
conceptions of substance, of individual substance (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">substantia
prima</span></span>), of incomplete, complete, and composite substances, of
substance considered as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> or principle of action, of substance
considered as <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">hypostasis</span></span>, as the actually existing individual
being which is the ultimate logical subject of all predications and
the ultimate ontological subject of all real determinations: the
philosopher who understands these concepts, and who admits
them to be validly grounded in experience, and to offer as far as
they go a correct interpretation of reality, will have no difficulty
in making up his mind about what is requisite to constitute a
person.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wherever he finds an existing individual being of any species,
a being which, even if it is really composite, is nevertheless really
one, such a being he will pronounce to be a <span class="tei tei-q">“subsisting individual
being”</span>. He may not be able, in the inorganic world or among
the lower forms of life, to distinguish for certain what is the real
individual from what may be perhaps only an accidental, if
natural, colony or group of real individuals. As a test he will
always seek for the manifestation of an internal directive principle
whereby all the vital functions of the organized mass of matter in
question are co-ordinated in such a manner as to make for the
preservation, growth and development of the whole throughout
a definite life cycle from birth to death. This formative and
directive principle is evidence of an individual unity of nature and
subsistence; and such evidence is abundantly present in <span class="tei tei-q">“individuals”</span>
of all the higher species in botany and zoology. The
<span class="tei tei-q">“individual subsisting being”</span> will therefore be a <span class="tei tei-q">“complete

human species is such. And all that is essential to his complete
individual human nature enters into and constitutes his person in
the concrete. Not merely, therefore, his intellect and will; not
merely his soul considered as <span class="tei tei-q">“mind,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> as the basis and

corporeal principle itself of his composite being, the body itself with
all its parts and members and organs: all these without exception

the common-sense view of the matter as evidenced by the ordinary
usages of language. We speak intelligibly no less than correctly

his soul or mind. And we make a no less accurate, intelligible,
and necessary distinction, when we distinguish between all that
which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">constitutes</span></em> the human person and that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whereby we know</span></em>
ourselves and other human individuals to be persons. Yet this
distinction is not kept clearly in mind by many modern philosophers,
who, approaching the study of personality exclusively
from the side of what the individual consciousness testifies as to
the unity and continuity (or otherwise) of mental life in the
individual, are scandalized at the assertion that the human body
can have anything to do with human personality.

be the result only of a long and carefully conducted analysis of
his own activities, and of inferences based on the character of

processes, emphasizes an important fact that is sometimes lost
sight of: the fact that some section at least of the individual's
conscious mental life is common to, and present throughout, the
two or more <span class="tei tei-q">“states”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“conditions”</span> between which any such
abnormal individual is found to alternate. This consideration is
itself sufficient to disprove the theory—to which we shall presently
refer—that there is or may be in the individual human
being a double, or even a multiple <span class="tei tei-q">“human personality”</span>.

75. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">False Theories of Personality.</span></span>—It is plain that conscious
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mental activity</span></em> cannot <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">constitute</span></em> human personality, or subconscious
mental activity either, for all activity is of the accidental
mode of being, is an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accident</span></em>, whereas a person must be a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em>.
Of course it is the self-conscious cognitive activity of the
human individual that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reveals</span></em> to the latter his own self as a
person: it is the exercise of reflex consciousness combined with
memory that gives us the feeling of personal identity with ourselves
throughout the changing events of our mental and bodily
life. Furthermore, this self-consciousness has its root in the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rational</span></em> nature of the human individual; and rationality of
nature is the differentiating principle which makes the subsisting
individual a <span class="tei tei-q">“person”</span> as distinct from a (subsisting) <span class="tei tei-q">“thing”</span>. But
then, it is not the feeling of personal identity that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">constitutes</span></em> the
person. Actual consciousness is neither the essence, nor the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
source, nor even the index of personality; for it is only an
activity, and an activity which reveals immediately not the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">person</span></em>
as such, but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> as rational;<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href="#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a> nor does the rational
(substantial) principle of a composite nature constitute the latter
a person; but only the subsistence of the complete (composite)
individual nature itself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These considerations are sufficiently obvious; they presuppose,
however, the truth of the traditional doctrine already explained
in regard to the existence, nature and cognoscibility of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em>.
Philosophers who have misunderstood and rejected and lost
this traditional doctrine of substance have propounded many
varieties of unsatisfactory and inconsistent theories in regard to
what constitutes <span class="tei tei-q">“person”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“personality”</span>. The main feature
of all such theories is their identification of personality with the
habitual consciousness of self, or habitual feeling of personal
identity: a feeling which, however, must be admitted to include
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">memory</span></em> in some form, while the function of memory in any shape
or form cannot be satisfactorily explained on any theory of the
human <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego</span></em> which denies that there is a human <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em> persisting
permanently as a unifying principle of successive mental
states (<a href="#Section_63" class="tei tei-ref">63-4</a>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So far as English philosophy is concerned such theories
appear to have had their origin in Locke's teaching on person
and personal identity. Discussing the notions of identity and
diversity,<a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href="#note_312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a> he distinguishes between the identity of an individual
substance with itself in its duration throughout time, and what
he terms personal identity; while by identity in general he
means not abstract identity but the concrete permanence of a
thing throughout time (<a href="#Section_34" class="tei tei-ref">34</a>). On this we have to call attention
to the fact that just as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">duration</span></em> is not essential to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">constitution</span></em>
of a substance, so neither is it essential to the constitution of a
complete subsisting individual substance or person (<a href="#Section_64" class="tei tei-ref">64</a>); though
it is, of course, an essential condition for all human apprehension
whether of substance or of person. Locke was wrong, therefore,
in confounding what reveals to us the abiding permanence,
identity or sameness of a subsisting thing or person (whether the
<span class="tei tei-q">“self”</span> or any other subsisting thing or person) throughout
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its duration in time, with what constitutes the subsisting thing
or person.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Furthermore, his distinction between substantial identity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
the sameness of an individual substance with itself throughout
time, and personal identity or sameness, was also an error. For
as long as there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em> unity, continuity, or identity of
the subsisting individual substance, so long is there unity, continuity,
or identity of its subsistence, or of its personality if it be
a rational substance. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subsistence</span></em> of a complete individual
inorganic substance is changed as soon as the individual undergoes
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em> change: we have them no longer <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the same</span></em>
subsisting individual being. So, too, the subsistence of the
organic individual is changed as soon as the latter undergoes
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em> change by the dissolution of life, by the separation
of its formative and vital substantial principle from its
material substantial principle: after such dissolution we have no
longer <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the same</span></em> subsisting plant or animal. And, finally, the
subsistence of an individual man is changed, or interrupted, or
ceases by death, which separates his soul, his vital principle, from
his body. We say, moreover, that in the latter case the human
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">person</span></em> ceases to exist when the identity or permanence of his
subsisting substance or nature terminates at death; for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal
identity</span></em> we hold to be the identity of the complete subsisting substance
or nature with itself. But Locke, who practically agrees
with what we have said regarding the abiding identity of the subsisting
individual being with itself—whether this individual be
an inorganic individual, a plant, a brute beast, or a man<a id="noteref_313" name="noteref_313" href="#note_313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a>—distinguishes
at this point between identity of the subsisting individual
substance and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal</span></em> identity.

Of identity in general he says that <span class="tei tei-q">“to conceive and judge of

To find wherein personal identity consists, we must consider what person
stands for; which, I think, is a thinking, intelligent being, that has reason and
reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing in different
times and places; which it does only by that consciousness which is inseparable
from thinking, and, as it seems to me, essential to it. When we see, hear,
smell, taste, feel, meditate, or will any thing, we know that we do so. Thus
it is always as to our present sensations and perceptions, and by this every one
is to himself what he calls self; it not being considered in this case whether
the same self be continued in the same or divers substances. For since consciousness
always accompanies thinking, and it is that which makes every one

The definition of person in this passage as <span class="tei tei-q">“a thinking,
intelligent being,”</span> etc., is not far removed from our own definition;
but surely conscious thought is not <span class="tei tei-q">“that which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">makes</span></em>

is only an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">activity</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">function</span></em> of the <span class="tei tei-q">“rational being”</span>. It is

is Locke's own definition of <span class="tei tei-q">“person”</span>—were there all

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">presuppose</span></em> the <span class="tei tei-q">“person,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“thinking, intelligent being,”</span> or, as
we have expressed it, the <span class="tei tei-q">“subsisting, rational, individual nature”</span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">already constituted</span></em>; and it is equally plain that the <span class="tei tei-q">“personal

identity, personal or otherwise, unless they were the acts of one

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet Locke thinks he can divorce personal identity from
identity of substance, and account for the former independently
of the latter. In face of the obvious difficulty that actual consciousness
is not continuous but intermittent, he tries to maintain
that the consciousness which links together present states
with remembered states is sufficient to constitute personal identity
even although there may have intervened between the present and
the past states a complete change of substance, so that it is
really a different substance which experiences the present states
from that which experienced the past states. The question

concerns not personal identity at all: the question being, what makes the
same person, and not whether it be the same identical substance, which
always thinks in the same person: different substances, by the same consciousness
(where they do partake in it), being united into one person, as
well as different bodies by the same life are united into one animal, whose

Here the contention is that we can have <span class="tei tei-q">“the same person”</span>
and yet not necessarily <span class="tei tei-q">“the same identical substance,”</span> because
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">consciousness</span></em> may give a personal unity to distinct and successive
substances in the individual man just as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">animal life</span></em> gives an
analogous unity to distinct and successive substances in the
individual animal. This is very superficial; for it only substitutes
for the problem of human personality the similar problem
of explaining the unity and sameness of subsistence in the
individual living thing: a problem which involves the fact of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">memory</span></em> in animals. For scholastic philosophers unity of life in
the living thing, involving the fact of memory in animals, is explained
by the perfectly intelligible and will-grounded teaching
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that there is in each individual living thing a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formative and vital
principle</span></em> which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em>, a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span>, which unites,
in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abiding self-identical unity of a complete individual composite
substance</span></em>, the material principle of the corporeal substances
which thus go, in the incessant process of substantial change
known as metabolism, to form partially, and to support the
substantial continuity of, the living individual. While the latter
is thus in constant process of material, or partial, substantial
change, it remains, as long as it lives, the same complete individual
substance, and this in virtue of the abiding <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em>
formative and vital principle which actuates and animates it.
The abiding permanence or self-identity of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subsisting individual
substance</span></em> which feels or thinks, and remembers, is an
intelligible, and indeed the only intelligible, ground and explanation
of memory, and of our consciousness of personal identity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if we leave out of account this abiding continuity and
self-identity of the subsisting individual substance or nature,
which is the subject, cause and agent of these acts of memory
and consciousness, how can these latter, in and by themselves,
possibly form, or even indeed reveal to us, our personal identity?
Locke felt this difficulty; and he tried in vain to meet it: in
vain, for it is insuperable. He merely suggests that <span class="tei tei-q">“the same
consciousness ... can be transferred from one thinking substance
to another,”</span> in which case <span class="tei tei-q">“it will be possible that two
thinking substances may make [successively] one person”</span>.<a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a>
This is practically his last word on the question,—and it is worthy
of note, for it virtually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantializes consciousness</span></em>. It makes
consciousness, which is really only an act or a series of acts, a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something substantial and subsisting</span></em>. We have seen already how
modern phenomenists, once they reject the notion of substance
as invalid or superfluous, must by that very fact equivalently
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantialize accidents</span></em> (<a href="#Section_61" class="tei tei-ref">61</a>); for substance, being a necessary
category of human thought as exercised on reality, cannot really
be dispensed with. And we see in the present context an
illustration of this fact. The abiding self-identity of the human
person cannot be explained otherwise than by the abiding self-identical
subsistence of the individual human substance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If personal identity were constituted and determined by consciousness,
by the series of conscious states connected and
unified by memory, then it would appear that the human being

in infancy, in sleep, in unconsciousness, or in a state of insanity,
is not a human person! Philosophers who have not the hardihood
to deny human personality to the individual of the human
species in these states, and who on the other hand will not
recognize the possession of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rational nature</span></em> or substance by the
subsisting individual as the ground of the latter's personality and
personal identity, have recourse to the hypothesis of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sub-conscious</span></em>,
or <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sub-liminal</span></em>”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">consciousness</span></em> in the individual, as a
substitute. If by this they merely meant an abiding <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em>
rational principle of all mental activities, even of those which
may be semi-conscious or sub-conscious, they would be merely
calling by another name what we call the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rational nature</span></em> of man.
And the fact that they refer to this principle as the sub-conscious
<span class="tei tei-q">“self”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Ego”</span> shows how insistent is the rational need for
rooting personality and personal identity in something which is
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em>. But they do not and will not conceive it as a substance;

<span class="tei tei-q">“function,”</span> or a <span class="tei tei-q">“series”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“stream”</span> of processes or functions,

Unable as he was to explain how the same consciousness

distinct substances (except by virtually substantializing consciousness),
Locke nevertheless persisted in holding that consciousness

persisting substance or nature which remembers), constitutes
personality and personal identity. We have dwelt upon his

76. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ontology and the Accident-Modes of Being.</span></span>—Under
the ultimate category or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genus supremum</span></span> of Substance experience
reveals to us two broadly distinct sub-classes: corporeal
substances, <span class="tei tei-q">“bodies”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“material”</span> things, and spiritual substances
or <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits”</span>. Of these latter we have direct experience
only of one class, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">embodied</span></em> spirits or human souls. The investigation
of the nature of these belongs to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Psychology</span></em>, and from
the data of that science we may infer, by the light of reason, the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possibility</span></em> of another class of spirits, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure</span></em> spirits, beings of whose
actual existence we know from Divine Revelation. The existence
of a Supreme Being, Whom we must conceive analogically as substance
and spirit, is demonstrated by the light of reason in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Natural Theology</span></em>. The investigation of the nature of corporeal
substances belongs properly to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cosmology</span></em>. Hence in the present
treatise we have no further direct concern with the substance-mode
of reality;<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href="#note_322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a> but only with its accident-modes, and not with all of
these.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not with all of them; for those which belong properly to
spiritual substances, or properly to corporeal substances, call for
special treatment in Psychology and Cosmology respectively. In
the main, only such species of accidents as are common to matter
and spirit alike, will form the subject of the remaining portion of
the present volume. Only the broader aspects of such categories
as Quality, Quantity and Causality—aspects which have a more
direct bearing on the Theory of Being and the Theory of
Knowledge in general,—call for treatment in General Metaphysics.
A more detailed treatment must be sought in other departments
of Philosophy.

<a name="Section_77" id="Section_77" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
77. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Nature of the Accident Called Quality.</span></span>—In the
widest sense of the term, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quality</span></em> is synonymous with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical attribute</span></em>.
In this sense whatever can be predicated of a subject,
whatever <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logically</span></em> determines a subject in any way for our thought
is a quality or <span class="tei tei-q">“attribute”</span> of that subject. In a sense almost
equally wide the term is used to designate any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> determination,
whether substantial or accidental, of a subject. In this sense
the differential element, or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia specifica</span></span>, determines the
generic element, or genus, of a substance: it tells us what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kind</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em> the substance is: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> what kind of animal a man is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>
rational; what kind of living thing an animal is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> sentient;
what kind of body or corporeal thing a plant is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> living.
And hence scholastics have said of the predicable <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">differentia
specifica</span></span>”</span> that it is predicated adjectivally, or as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quality</span></em>, to tell
us in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what the thing consists</span></em>, or what is its nature: differentia
specifica praedicatur <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in quale quid</span></em>: it gives us the determining
principle of the specific nature. Or, again, quality is used
synonymously with any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em> determination of a substance.
In this sense magnitude, location, action, etc., though
they determine a subject in different accidental ways, nevertheless
are all indiscriminately said to <span class="tei tei-q">“qualify”</span> it in the sense of determining
it somehow or other, and are therefore called <span class="tei tei-q">“qualities”</span>
in the wide sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“accidents”</span>. Hence, again, the scholastics
have said that inasmuch as all accidents determine or qualify their
subjects, they are predicated of these <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitatively</span></em>, and may be
called in a wide sense <span class="tei tei-q">“qualifications”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“qualities”</span>: omnia
genera accidentium qualificant substantiam et praedicantur <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
quale</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is in this wide sense that we use the term when we say
that the (specific) nature (or <span class="tei tei-q">“kind”</span>) of a thing is revealed by its
<span class="tei tei-q">“qualities”</span>; for the nature of a thing is revealed by all its accidents.
And when we infer the nature of a thing from its activities, in accordance
with the maxim <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Qualis est operatio talis est natura</span></span>, we
must take the term <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">operatio</span></span>”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“activity”</span> to include the operation
of the thing on our cognitive faculties, the states of cognitive
consciousness thus aroused in us, and all the other accidents thus
revealed to us in the thing by its <span class="tei tei-q">“knowledge-eliciting”</span> action
on our minds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quality</span></em> has been traditionally restricted, after
Aristotle, to designate properly one particular category of accidents
distinct from the others and from substance.

A definition proper of any <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genus supremum</span></span> is of course out of
the question. But it is not easy to give even a description which
will convey an accurate notion of the special category of Quality,
and mark it off from the other accident-categories. If we say
with Aristotle that quality is <span class="tei tei-q">“that whereby we are enabled to
describe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what sort</span></em> (ποιόν, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">quale</span></span>) anything is”</span><a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> that it is
white by whiteness, strong by strength, etc.—we are only illustrating
the abstract by the concrete. But even this serves the
purpose of helping us to realize what quality in general means.
For we are more familiar with the concrete than with the abstract:
and we can see a broad distinction between the question:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">What sort</span></em> is that thing? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Qualis</span></em> est ista res?”</span> (Quality), and
the question: <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">How large</span></em> is that thing? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quanta</span></em> est ista
res?”</span> (Quantity), or <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Where</span></em> is that thing?”</span> (Place), or <span class="tei tei-q">“What
is it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">doing</span></em>? What is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">happening</span></em> to it?”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Actio et Passio</span></span>), or
<span class="tei tei-q">“What does it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">resemble</span></em>?”</span> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Relation</span></em>), etc. This will help us
to realize that there are accidental modes of being which affect
substances in a different way from all the extrinsic denominations
of the latter (<a href="#Section_60" class="tei tei-ref">60</a>), and also in a different way from Quantity,
Relation, and Causality; and these modes of being, whereby the
substance is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of such a sort</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in such a condition</span></em>, we call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">qualities</span></em>.
And if we inquire what special kind of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">determination</span></em> of the substance
is common to qualities, and marks these off from the other
accidents, we shall find it to consist in this, that quality is an accidental
mode of being which so affects the substance that it disposes
the latter well or ill in regard to the perfections natural to
this particular kind of substance: it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alters</span></em> the latter accidentally
by increasing or diminishing its natural perfection. We have
seen that no created substance has all the perfection natural to its
kind, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tota simul</span></span> or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ab initio</span></span> (<a href="#Section_46" class="tei tei-ref">46</a>); that it fulfils its rôle in existence
by development, by tending towards its full or final perfection.
The accidental realities which supervene on its essence, and
thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alter</span></em> its perfection <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within the limits of its kind or species</span></em>,
are what we call qualities. They diversify the substance accidentally
in its perfection, in its concrete mode of existing and
behaving: by their appearance and disappearance they do not
change the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential perfection</span></em> of the substance (<a href="#Section_46" class="tei tei-ref">46</a>), they do not
effect a substantial change; but they change its intermediate,

accidental perfection; and this qualitative change is technically
known and described as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alteration</span></em><a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a> (<a href="#Section_11" class="tei tei-ref">11</a>).

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence we find <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quality</span></em> described by St. Thomas as the sort
of accident which modifies or disposes the substance in itself:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">accidens modificativum sen dispositivum substantiaein seipsa</span></span>,”</span> and
by Albertus Magnus somewhat more explicitly as <span class="tei tei-q">“the sort of
accident which completes and perfects substance in its existence
and activity: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">accidens complens ac perficiens substantiam tarn in
existendo quam in operando</span></span>”</span>.<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a> This notion will be conveyed with
sufficient clearness if we describe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quality</span></em> as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that absolute accident
which determines a substance after the manner of an accidental
</span><span class="tei tei-q">“differentia,”</span><span style="font-style: italic"> affecting the essential perfection of the substance in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence (1) the Pure Actuality of the Infinitely Perfect Being
cannot admit qualities, inasmuch as quality implies only a relative
and limited perfection; (2) the qualities of a corporeal
substance are grounded in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formative</span></em> principle which gives
that substance its specific nature and is the principle of its
tendency and development towards its final perfection, whereas
its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantity</span></em> is grounded in its determinable or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> principle;
(3) the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> differentiating principles of substances—being
known to us not intuitively, but only abstractively and discursively,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> by inference from the behaviour of these substances,
from the effects of their activities—are often designated not by
what constitutes them intrinsically, but by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental perfections</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">qualities</span></em> which are our only key to a knowledge of them.
For instance, we differentiate the nature of man from that of the
brute beast by describing the former as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rational</span></em>: a term which
really designates not the essence or nature itself, but one of its
fundamental qualities, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the faculty of reason.

78. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Immediate Sub-Classes of Quality as</span></span> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Genus Supremum</span></span>.—On
account of the enormous variety of qualities which
characterize the data of our experience, the problem of classifying
qualities is not a simple one. Its details belong to the special
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sciences and to the other departments of philosophy. Here we
must confine ourselves to an attempt at indicating the immediate
sub-classes of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genus supremum</span></span>. And in this context
it will not be out of place to call attention to a remarkable, and
in our view quite erroneous, trend of modern thought. It
accompanied the advent of what is known as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">atomism</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
mechanical conception of the universe</span></em>, a conception much in vogue
about half a century ago, but against which there are already
abundant evidences of a strong reaction. We refer to the inclination
of scientists and philosophers to eliminate Quality altogether
as an ultimately distinct category of human experience, by reducing
all qualities to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantity</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">local relations</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mechanical</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spatial
motions</span></em> of matter (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cf.</span></span> <a href="#Section_11" class="tei tei-ref">11</a>). In this theory all the sensible qualities
of the material universe would be really and objectively nothing
more than locations and motions of the ultimate constituents of
perceptible matter. All the chemical, physical and mechanical
energies or forces of external nature would be purely quantitative
dispositions or configurations of matter in motion: realities that
could be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exhaustively</span></em> known by mathematical analysis and
measurement. And when it was found that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitative</span></em> concepts
stubbornly resisted all attempts at elimination, or reduction to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantitative</span></em> concepts, even in the investigation of the material
universe or external nature, scientists and philosophers of external
nature thought to get rid of them by locating them exclusively
in the human mind, and thus pushing them over on
psychologists and philosophers of the mind for further and final
exorcism. For a time extreme materialists, less wise than daring,
endeavoured to reduce even mind and all its conscious states and
processes to a mere subjective aspect of what, looked at objectively,
would be merely matter in motion.<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> It can be shown in
Cosmology, Psychology, and Epistemology that all such attempts
to analyse qualities into something other than qualities, are utterly
unsatisfactory and unsuccessful. And we may see even from an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enumeration of some of the main classes of qualities that such
attempts were foredoomed to failure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Scholastic Philosophy has generally adopted Aristotle's division
of qualities into four great groups:<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a> (1) ἕξις ἢ διάθεσις,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus vel dispositio</span></span>; (2) δύναμις φυσικὴ ἢ ἀδυναμία, potentia
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">naturalis vel impotentia</span></span>; (3) ποιότητες παθητικαί καὶ πάθη,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentiae passivae et passiones</span></span>; (4) μορφὴ ἢ σχῆμα, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma vel
figura</span></span>. St. Thomas offers the following ground for this classification.
Since quality, he says,<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a> is an accidental determination
of the substance itself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of the perfection of its concrete
existence and activity, and since we may distinguish four
aspects of the substance: its nature itself as perfectible; its
intrinsic principles of acting and receiving action, principles
springing from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formative</span></em>, specific constituent of its nature;
its receptivity of change effected by such action, a receptivity
grounded in the determinable or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> principle of its nature;
and finally its quantity, if it be a corporeal substance,—we can
likewise distinguish between (1) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acquired habits or dispositions</span></em>,
such as health, knowledge, virtue, vice, etc., which immediately
determine the perfection of the substance, disposing it well or ill
in relation to its last end; (2) intrinsic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural forces</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faculties</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">powers of action</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aptitudes</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">capacities</span></em>, such as intellect, will,
imagination, instinct, organic vital forces, physical, chemical,
mechanical energies; (3) states resulting in a corporeal being
from the action of its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">milieu</span></em> upon it: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passions</span></em> and emotions
of sentient living things, such as sensations of pleasure, pain,
anger, etc.; the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensible qualities</span></em> of matter, such as colour, taste,
smell, temperature, feel or texture, etc.; and, finally (4) the
quality of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form or shape</span></em> which is a mere determination of the
quantity of a corporeal substance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This classification is not indeed perfect, for the same individual
quality can be placed in different classes when looked at
from different standpoints: heat, for instance, may be regarded
as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural operative power</span></em> of a substance in a state of combustion,
or as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensible quality</span></em> produced in that substance by the
operation of other agencies. But it has the merit of being an
exhaustive classification; and philosophers have not succeeded
in improving on it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Qualities of the third and fourth class do not call for special
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
treatment. In the third class, Aristotle's distinction between
ποιότητες παθητικαί (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitates passibiles</span></span>) and πάθη (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passiones</span></span>)
is based upon the relatively permanent or transient character of
the quality in question. The transient quality, such as the blush
produced by shame or the pallor produced by fear, would be a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passio</span></span>;<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a> whereas the more permanent quality, such as the
natural colour of the countenance, would be a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passibilis qualitas.</span></span>
The <span class="tei tei-q">“passions”</span> or sensible changes which result from certain
conscious states, and affect the organism of the sentient living
being, are included in this class as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passiones</span></span>; while the visible
manifestations of more permanent mental derangement or insanity
would be included in it as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passibiles qualitates</span></span>. We may,
perhaps, get a fairly clear and comprehensive notion of all that is
contained in this class as <span class="tei tei-q">“sensible qualities”</span> by realizing that
these embrace whatever is the immediate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em> or the immediate
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">result</span></em> of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sense modification involved in any act or process of
sense consciousness</span></em>. Such <span class="tei tei-q">“sensible qualities,”</span> therefore, belong
in part to the objects which provoke sense perception, and in
part to the sentient subject which elicits the conscious act. One
of the most important problems in the Theory of Knowledge,
and one which ramifies into Cosmology and Psychology, is that
of determining the precise significance of these <span class="tei tei-q">“sensible
qualities,”</span>—and especially in determining whether they are
qualities of an extramental reality, or merely states of the
individual mind or consciousness itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Form</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">figure</span></em>, which constitutes the fourth class of quality, is a
mode of the quantity of a body, being merely the particular surface
termination of its extension or volume. Considered as a mode
of abstract or mathematical quantity, it belongs to the domain
of mathematics. Considered in the concrete body, it is the
physical, sensible form, shape, or figure, of the latter; and here
it may be either natural or artificial, according as it results from
the unimpeded action of natural forces or from these forces as
manipulated and directed by intelligent agents. It is worthy of
special note that while extension or volume is indicative of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> principle of corporeal substances, the figure or shape
naturally assumed by this volume is determined by their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formative</span></em>
principle, and is thus indicative of their specific nature. This
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is already noticeable in the inorganic world, where many of the
chemically different substances assume each its own distinctive
crystalline form. But it is particularly in the domains of botany
and zoology that the natural external form of the living individual
organism is recognized as one of the most important
grounds of its classification and one of the surest tests of its
specific nature.<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
79. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Habits and Dispositions.</span></span>—Every created being is
subject to change, capable of development or retrogression, endowed
with a natural tendency towards some end which it can reach
by a natural process of activity, and which constitutes for it, when
attained, its full and final perfection (<a href="#Section_66" class="tei tei-ref">66</a>). Through this process
of change it acquires accidental modes of being which help it or
hinder it, dispose it or indispose it, in the exercise of its natural activities,
and therefore also in the concrete perfection of its nature as
tending towards its natural end. Such an accidental mode of
being is acquired by a series of transient actions and experiences,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actiones et passiones</span></span>: after these have passed away it remains, and
not merely as a state or condition resulting from the changes
wrought in the subject by these experiences, but as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disposition</span></em>
towards easier repetition of such experiences. Moreover, it may
be not a mere transient disposition, but something stable and
permanent, not easily removed or annulled, a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dispositio difficile
mobilis</span></span>. And just as it is essentially indicative of past actions
whereby it was acquired, so, too, the very <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'être</span></span> of its actuality
is to dispose its subject for further and future changes,
for operations and effects which are not yet actual but only
potential in this subject. Such an accidental mode of being is
what Aristotle called ἕξις, and the scholastics <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus</span></span>. With
Aristotle, they define <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habit</span></em> as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more or less stable disposition
whereby a subject is well or ill disposed in itself or in relation to
other things</span></em>: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Habitus dicitur dispositio difficile mobilis secundum

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The difference between a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habit</span></em> (ἕξις) and a simple <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disposition</span></em>
(διάθεσις) is that the former is by nature a more or less <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stable</span></em>
quality while the latter is unstable and transient. Moreover, the
facilities acquired by repeated action of the organs or members
of men or animals, and the particular <span class="tei tei-q">“set”</span> acquired by certain
tools or instruments from continued use, are more properly called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dispositions</span></em> than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habits</span></em>: they are not habits in the strict sense,
though they are often called habits in the ordinary and looser
usage of common speech. A little reflection will show that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
only proper subjects of natural habits in the strict sense are the
spiritual faculties of an intelligent and free agent</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since all natural habits are acquired by the past activities,
and dispose for the future activities, of a being not absolutely
perfect, but partly potential and partly actual, and subject to
change, it follows that only finite beings can have habits. But,
furthermore, beings that are not free, that have not control or
dominion of their own actions, that have not freedom of choice,
are determined by their nature, by a necessary law of their activity,
to elicit the actions which they do actually elicit: such beings
are by their nature <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">determinata ad unumn</span></span>; they are confined
necessarily to the particular lines of action whereby they fulfil
their rôle in the actual order of things. As Aristotle remarks,
you may throw the same stone repeatedly in the same direction
and with the same velocity: it will never acquire a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habit</span></em> of moving
in that direction with that velocity.<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a> The same is true of plants
and animals; for a habit in the strict sense implies not merely a
certain mutability in its subject; it implies, and consists in, a
stable modification of some power or faculty <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which can have its
activities directed indifferently in one or other of a variety of channels
or lines</span></em>: the power or faculty which is the proper subject of a
habit must be a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia dirigibilis vel determinabilis ad diversa</span></span>.
Hence merely material powers of action—such as the mechanical,
physical and chemical forces of inorganic nature, or the
organic powers of living bodies, whether vegetative or merely
sentient,—since they are all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of themselves</span></em>, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their nature</span></em>,
determined to certain lines of action, and to these only,—such
powers cannot become the subjects of habits, of stable dispositions
towards one line of action rather than another. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
powers of material nature,”</span> says St. Thomas, <span class="tei tei-q">“do not elicit their
operations by means of habits, for they are of themselves [already
adequately] determined to their particular lines of action.”</span><a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href="#note_333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Only the spiritual faculties of free agents are, then, the proper
seat of real habits. Only of free agents can we say strictly that
<span class="tei tei-q">“habit is second nature”</span>. Only these can direct the operations
of their intellect and will, and through these latter the operations
of their sense faculties, both cognitive and appetitive, in a way
conducive to their last end or in a way that deviates therefrom,
by attaching their intellects to truth or to error, their wills to
virtue or to vice, and thus forming in these faculties stable dispositions
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habits</span></em>.<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href="#note_334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a>

Is there any sense, then, in which we can speak of the sentient
(cognitive and appetitive) and executive powers of man as the

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">commanded</span></em> by the latter; they are acts that issue primarily from
the latter faculties; and hence the dispositions that result from
repetition of these acts and give a facility for further repetition of
them—acts of talking, walking, singing, playing musical instruments,
exercising any handicraft—are partly, though only
secondarily, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dispositions</span></em> formed in these sentient faculties (the

taste, the <span class="tei tei-q">“alert”</span> sense of touch in the deaf, dumb, or blind), or
in these executive powers, whereby the latter more promptly and
easily obey the <span class="tei tei-q">“command”</span> of the higher faculties; but they are
primarily and principally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habits</span></em> of these higher faculties themselves
rendering the latter permanently <span class="tei tei-q">“apt”</span> to <span class="tei tei-q">“command”</span> and

Unquestionably the bodily organs acquire by exercise a definite
<span class="tei tei-q">“set”</span> which facilitates their further exercise. But this <span class="tei tei-q">“set”</span> is
not something that they can use themselves; nor is it something
that removes or lessens a natural indeterminateness or indifference
of these powers; for they are not indifferent: they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> act,
at any instant, in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> way which their concrete nature in all

moreover, from the soul which is the formative principle that

they are not of themselves, of their own nature, stable;
whereas the acquired dispositions of the spiritual faculties, intellect
and will, rooted as they are in a subject that is spiritual and
substantially immutable, are of their own nature stable and permanent.
Nor are all dispositions of these latter faculties to be

them the special character of stability. Hence mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">opinion</span></em> in

we may apply what has been said in regard to the sense faculties

If, then, habits belong properly to intellect and will, and if their
function is to dispose or indispose the human agent for the attainment
of the perfection in which his last end consists, we must
naturally look to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Psychology</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ethics</span></em> for a detailed analysis of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them. Here we must be content with a word on their origin,
their effects, and their importance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Habits are produced by acts. The act modifies the faculty.
If, for instance, nothing remained in our cognitive faculties after
each transient cognitive act had passed, memory would be
inexplicable and knowledge impossible; nor could the repetition
of any act ever become easier than its first performance. This
something that remains is a habit, or the beginning of a habit
A habit may be produced by a single act: the mind's first intuition
of an axiom or principle produces a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habit or habitual knowledge</span></em>
of that principle. But as a rule it requires a repetition of any act,
and that for a long time at comparatively short intervals, to
produce a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habit</span></em> of that act, a stable disposition whereby it can be
readily repeated; and to strengthen and perfect the habit the acts
must be formed with a growing degree of intensity and energy.
Progress in virtue demands sustained and increasingly earnest
efforts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The natural effect of habit is to perfect the faculty,<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href="#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a> to increase
its energy, to make it more prompt to act, and thus to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facilitate</span></em>
the performance of the act for which the habit disposes it. It
also engenders and develops a natural <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">need</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tendency</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desire</span></em> to
repeat the act, and a natural aversion from the acts opposed
to the habit. Finally, according as the habit grows, the performance
of the act demands less effort, calls for less actual
attention; thus the habit diminishes the feeling of effort and tends
to bring about a quasi-automatic and semi-conscious form of
activity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Good habits are those which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect</span></em> the nature of the agent,
which advance it towards the realization of its end; bad habits
are those which retard and prevent the realization of this end.
Hence the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ethical</span></em> importance, to the human person, of forming,
fostering and confirming good habits, as also of avoiding, resisting
and eradicating bad habits, can scarcely be exaggerated.

The profound and all-pervading influence of habit in the mental
and moral life of man is unfortunately far from being adequately
appreciated even by those responsible for the secular, moral and
religious education of the young. This is perhaps mainly due
to the fact that the influence of habit on the conduct of life,
enormous as it is in fact, is so secret, so largely unconscious, that
it easily escapes notice. Careful reflection on our actions,
diligent study of the springs of action in our everyday life, are
needed to reveal this influence. But the more we analyse
human conduct in ourselves and others, the more firmly convinced
we become that human character and conduct are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mainly</span></em>
dependent on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the formation of habits</span></em>. Habits are the grand
conserving and perfecting—or the terrible undermining and
destroying—force of life. They are the fruit of our past and the
seed of our future. In them the words of Leibniz find their
fullest verification: <span class="tei tei-q">“the present is laden with the past and
pregnant with the future”</span>. By forming good habits we escape
the disheartening difficulties of perpetual beginnings; and thus
the labour we devote to the acquisition of wisdom and virtue has
its first rich recompense in the facility it gives us to advance on
the path of progress.

the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proximate</span></em> principles of the latter?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No doubt when any individual nature is acted upon by other
agencies, when it undergoes real change under the influence of
its environment, its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive potentiality</span></em> is being so far forth
actualized. Moreover when the nature itself acts <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immanently</span></em>,
the term of such action remaining within the agent itself to
actualize or perfect it, some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive potentiality</span></em> of the agent is
being actualized. In these cases the nature before being thus
actualized was really capable of such actualization. This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive
potentiality</span></em>, however, is itself nothing actual, it implies no actual
perfection in the nature. But we must distinguish carefully from
this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive or receptive potentiality</span></em> of a nature its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active or
operative powers</span></em>—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentiae operativae</span></span>. These may be themselves
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual perfections</span></em> in the nature, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em> perfections actually in
the nature, and perhaps really distinct from it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That they are indeed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> perfections of the nature is fairly
obvious: it is an actual perfection of a nature to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proximately</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediately</span></em>, and without any further complement or addition
to its reality, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">capable of acting</span></em>; and this is true whether the
action in question be immanent or transitive: if it be immanent,
the perfection resulting from the action, the term of the latter,
will be a perfection of the agent itself, and in this case the agent
by virtue of its operative power will have had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the capacity of perfecting
itself</span></em>; while if the action be transitive the agent will have
had, in virtue of its operative power, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the capacity of producing perfections
in other things</span></em>. In either case such capacity is undoubtedly
an actual perfection of the agent that possesses it.
Hence the truth of the scholastic formula: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Omne agens agit in
quantum est in</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">actu</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">patiatur vero inquantum est in</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">potentia</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Furthermore, all such operative powers are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really distinct from
the actions</span></em> which immediately proceed from them: this, too, is
obvious, for while the operative power is a stable, abiding
characteristic of the agent, the actions elicited by means of it are
transient.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But what is the nature of this operative power in relation to
the nature itself of the agent? It is an actual perfection of this
nature. It is, moreover, unlike acquired habits, native to this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nature, born with it so to speak, naturally inseparable from it.
Further still, operative powers would seem to be all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">properties</span></em>
(<a href="#Section_69" class="tei tei-ref">69</a>) of their respective natures: inasmuch as it is only in virtue
of the operative power that the nature can act, and there can be
no nature without connatural operations whereby it tends to
realize the full and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> perfection of its being, the perfection which
is the very <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'être</span></span> of its presence in the actual order of things.
The question therefore narrows itself down to this: Are operative
powers, which perfect the nature of which they are properties, really
distinct from this nature, or are they only virtually distinct aspects
under which we view the nature itself? For example, when we
speak of intellect and will as being faculties of the human soul,
do we merely mean that intellect is the soul itself regarded as
capable of reasoning, and will the soul itself regarded as capable
of willing? Or do we mean that the soul is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by itself</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
virtue of its own essence</span></em> capable of reasoning and willing; that it
can reason and will only through the instrumentality of two
realities of the accidental order, really distinct from, though at
the same time <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em> rooted in and springing from, the substance
of the soul itself: realities which we call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">powers</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faculties</span></em>?
Or again, when we speak of a man or an animal as having various
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sense faculties</span></em>—internal and external, cognitive, appetitive, executive—do
we merely mean that the living, sentient organism is itself
directly capable of eliciting acts of various kinds: of imagining,
desiring, seeing, hearing, etc.? Or do we mean that the organism
can elicit these various acts only by means of several accidental
realities, really distinct from, and inhering in, itself?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If such operative powers or faculties are naturally inseparable
from the substance in which they inhere, if they are so necessarily
consequent on the nature of the latter that it cannot exist without
them, are they anything more than virtually distinct aspects of the
substance itself? On this question, as we have already seen (<a href="#Section_69" class="tei tei-ref">69</a>),
scholastics are not agreed. St. Thomas, and Thomists generally,
maintain that intellect and will are really distinct from the substance
of the soul, and likewise that the sense faculties are really
distinct from the substance of the animated organism in which
they inhere.<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> In this view the distinction is not merely a virtual
distinction between different aspects of the soul (or the organism)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
itself, grounded in the variety and complexity of the acts which
emanate from the latter: the faculties are real entities of the accidental
order, mediating between the substance and its actions,
and involving in the concrete being a plurality which, however,
is not incompatible with the real unity of the latter (<a href="#Section_69" class="tei tei-ref">69</a>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following are some of the arguments urged in proof of a
real distinction:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Existence and action are two really distinct actualities;
therefore the potentialities which they actualize must be really
distinct: for such is the transcendental relation between the
potential and the actual that any potential subject and the corresponding
perfection which actualizes it must belong to the same
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genus supremum</span></span>: the one cannot be a substance and the other
an accident.<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a> Now existence is the actuality of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essence</span></em> and
action is the actuality of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">operative power</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faculty</span></em>. But action is
certainly an accident; therefore the operative power which it actualizes
must also be an accident, and must therefore be really
distinct from the substance of which it is a power, and of which
existence is the actuality. This line of argument applies with
equal force to all created natures.<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href="#note_344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Infinite Being alone are operation and substance identical.
No creature is operative in virtue of its substance. The
actions of a creature cannot be actualizations <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of its substance</span></em>:
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existence</span></em> is the actualization of its substance; therefore its actions
must be actualizations of potentialities which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidents</span></em> distinct
from its substance; in other words, of operative powers which
belong indeed necessarily to its substance but are really distinct
from the latter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This argument rests on very ultimate metaphysical conceptions.
But not all scholastics will admit the assumptions it involves.
How, for instance, does it appear that the created or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
finite substance as such cannot be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediately</span></em> operative? Even
were it immediately operative its actions would still be accidents,
and the distinction between Creator and creature would stand untouched.
The operative power must be an accident because the
action which actualizes it, the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus secundus</span></span>,”</span> is an accident.
But the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">consequentia</span></span> has not been proved, and it is not self-evident.
On the theory of the real distinction, is not the operative power itself
an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual perfection</span></em> of the substance, and therefore in some sort an
actualization of the latter? And yet they are not in the same
ultimate category, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in eodem genere supremo</span></span>. The nature which is
the potential subject, perfected by the operative power, is a substance,
while the operative power which perfects the substance by
actualizing this potentiality is an accident. Of course there is
not exactly the same correlation between substance and operative
power as between the latter and action. But anyhow the action
is in some true sense an actualization of the substance, at least
through the medium of the power, unless we are prepared to break
up the concrete unity of the agent by referring the action solely
to the power of the agent, and isolating the substance of the
latter as a sort of immutable core which merely <span class="tei tei-q">“exists”</span>: a mode
of conceiving the matter, which looks very like the mistake of
reifying abstract concepts. And if the action is in any true sense
an actualization of the substance, we have, after all, a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia</span></span> and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> which are not in the same ultimate category.

These considerations carry us, of course, right into what is perhaps the
most fundamental of all metaphysical problems: that of the mode in which
finite reality is actual. In its concrete actuality every finite real being is essentially
subject to change: its actuality is not </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">tota simul</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">: at every instant

How, then, are we to conceive aright the

existing substance is ever being really and actually, though accidentally,
determined, changed, modified, improved or disimproved, in its total concrete
existing reality. Even when these changes are not so profound as to destroy
its substantial identity and thus terminate its actuality as an individual being,
even when, in other words, they are not substantial, they are none the less real
and really affect the substance. Since they are real they necessarily involve
the recognition of really distinct principles in the concrete being and preclude
the view that the distinctions which we recognize in the ever-changing modes
of its actuality, as revealed to us in time and space, are all </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">merely</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> conceptual or
logical distinctions projected by the mind into what would therefore be in fact
a simple and immutable reality. The denial of any real distinction between
successive actual states, or between co-existing principles of those states, in any
finite being, would lead logically to the Eleatic doctrine, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> to denial of the
reality of change. On the other hand, while recognizing that change is a reality
and not a subjective mental illusion, and that real change can be grounded
only in a plurality of really distinct principles in the finite individual being, we
must at the same time hold that this plurality of really distinct principles in the
individual does not destroy a real unity, stability, and self-identical continuity
of the individual being in the mode of its actuality throughout time. Not, of
course, that this stability or sameness of the individual throughout time is complete
and adequate to the exclusion of all real change, but it is certainly a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">real</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
continuity of one and the same individual being: to deny this would be to remove

merely from the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">static</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> point of view, which is the natural standpoint of

philosophy which is the latest fashion among contemporary systems, that of the
brilliant French thinker and writer, Bergson, has at all events the merit of emphasizing
this important truth, that if our philosophical analysis of experience
is to be fruitful we must try to grasp reality not merely as it presents itself to
abstract thought at any section drawn by the latter through the incessant

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) A thing cannot be really identical with a variety of things
that are really distinct from one another; but the faculties of the
soul are really distinct from one another; therefore they must be
really distinct from the substance of the soul. The minor premiss
is supported by these considerations: The vegetative and
sentient operations of the human individual are operations of the
living <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">organism</span></em>, while the higher operations of rational thought
and volition are operations of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">soul alone</span></em>, the spiritual or immaterial
principle in the individual. But the immaterial principle
cannot be really and adequately identical with the animated organism.
Therefore the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">powers</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediate principles</span></em> of these two
classes of functions, belonging as they do to two really (though
not adequately) distinct substantial principles, cannot be really
identical with one of them, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> with the soul itself, the spiritual
principle. Again: The exercise of certain functions by the
human individual is subordinate to, and dependent on the previous
exercise of other functions. For example, actual volition is
necessarily dependent and consequent on actual thought: we
cannot will or desire any good without first knowing it as a good.
But the immediate principle of any function or activity cannot be
dependent on or subordinate to itself. Therefore the immediate
principles of such controlling and controlled activities—intellect
and will, for example—must be really distinct faculties.<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a>

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Suppose the substance or nature of an agent—the human
individual, for instance—were really identical with all its powers
or faculties, that these were merely the nature itself viewed under
different aspects, so that there would be in reality only one operative
power in the individual, then there would be no reason why the
individual could not or should not at any instant elicit one single
action or operation which would be simultaneously an act of
thinking, willing, seeing, hearing, etc., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> which would have at
once in itself the modalities of all human activities. But universal
experience testifies, on the contrary, that the operations of the
individual are each of some particular mode only, that he cannot
elicit every mode of human activity simultaneously, that he never
elicits one single act having a variety of modes. But why could he
not, if his substance or nature itself were the one and only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proximate principle</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of all his modes of activity? Because the conditions
for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">full and adequate</span></em> exercise of this one single or proximate
principle (at once substance and power) are never realized!
But it is arbitrary to assume the existence of a power which could
never pass fully into the act connatural to it. And moreover,
even if these conditions are partially realized we should see as a
consequence of this some human activity which would manifest
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in some degree at least</span></em> all the modalities of the various human
actions of which we have experience. But we have no experience
of a single human activity manifesting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in any degree</span></em> the modalities
of the numerous and really distinct human activities which experience
reveals to us. Hence the variety of these really distinct
modes of activity can be explained only by the fact that the
human individual elicits them through proximate operative principles
or powers which are really distinct from one another and
from the nature itself of the individual.<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a>

The problem of analysing and classifying the forces, faculties, or powers
of the subsisting things and persons in the universe of our experience, belongs
partly to Cosmology and partly to Psychology. In the latter it becomes
mainly a problem of classifying our mental acts, functions, or processes—our
states of consciousness. Apart from the question whether or not our mental
faculties are really distinct from one another and from the human nature
or substance itself of the individual, the problem of their proper classification
is important from the point of view of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">method</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> and of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">accurate psychological

are not unanimous in declaring the distinction to be real. But it is at
least a virtual distinction; and even as such it gives rise to the problem of
classification. It will be sufficient here to indicate the general principle on
which the classification proceeds: Wherever the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">acts</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> are </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">adequately distinct</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">

scholastics distinguish two mental faculties of the higher or spiritual order,
intellect and will; and in the lower or sense order of mental life they distinguish
one appetitive faculty, sense appetite, and several cognitive sense
faculties.

very dissimilar, very unlike one another.

increase or diminish in the same substance, while numerically
(and specifically) distinct substances can have the same kind of
quality in different degrees. This is manifest in regard to
<span class="tei tei-q">“habits,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“passions”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“sensible qualities”</span>. On the other
hand, it is clearly not true of <span class="tei tei-q">“form”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“figure”</span>. Different
individuals can have the same kind of <span class="tei tei-q">“natural power”</span> in different
degrees. One man may be naturally of keener intellect
and stronger will than another: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">weak</span></em> power was what
Aristotle called ἀδυναμία (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">impotentia</span></span>). But whether the

decrease in strength or intensity—and not merely the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">habits</span></em> that
affect these powers—is not so clear. Operative powers are
certainly perfected (or injured) by the acquisition of good (or bad)
habits. In the view of those who deny a real distinction between
natural operative power or faculty and substance, it is, of course,
the substance itself that is so perfected (or injured).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This attribute, therefore, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> found in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> qualities; but it is

the same numerical quality affects <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the same part</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the same

more or less <span class="tei tei-q">“qualified”</span> in some particular way. This is clearly
something quite different from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extension</span></em> of the same quality
to different parts (or its withdrawal from different parts) of the
same extended subject. In a corporeal, extended substance,
there can accordingly be question of both kinds of change, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intensive</span></em>

And the fact of intensive change of qualities is an undeniable fact
of experience. In what manner does it take place? Some
authors conceive it as an addition or subtraction of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grades</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">degrees</span></em>
of the same quality. Others, conceiving qualities as simple,

of distinct grades of any quality, conceive such change to take
place by this simple entity affecting its subject <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more or less intimately</span></em>,
becoming <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more or less firmly rooted</span></em>, as it were, in its

inherence in a variety of ways, all of which are grounded on certain
texts of St. Thomas:<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a> the quality receives a new accidental

many other real accidents such as qualities and energies, chemical,
physical and mechanical; that they are subject to real change,

Among the characteristics recognized by physicists in all
perceptible matter—divisibility, commensurability, impenetrability,
passivity or inertia, subjection to external forces or
energies, external extension or volume, internal quantity or
mass—there are none more fundamental than those of volume
and mass, or extension and quantity.<a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a> Nowhere, however, do we
find a better illustration of the fact that it is impossible to give a
definition proper of any supreme category, or even a description
of it by the aid of any more elementary notions, than in the
attempts of philosophers to describe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quantity</span></em>. When, for instance,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that accident of a corporeal substance or body in virtue of which the
latter so exists that it has parts outside parts in space</span></em>, we have to
admit at once that the notions expressed by the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“parts,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“outside”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“space”</span> are no simpler than the notion of extension
itself: in fact our notions of <span class="tei tei-q">“place”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">locus</span></span>) and <span class="tei tei-q">“space”</span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">spatium</span></span>) are derived from, and presuppose, that of extension.
This, however, is no serious disadvantage; for the description,
such as it is, indicates what we mean by the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“local,
spatial, external, actual extension,”</span> and declares this latter to be
an accident of corporeal substances.

83. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Corporeal Substance, Quantity and Extension.</span></span>—The
corporeal substance is an essentially composite substance,
resulting from the union of two distinct essential constitutive
principles. It exists in itself and is the ultimate subject of all
the determinations whereby it reveals itself to our senses. Its
actual extension in space is a fundamental mode or determination
of its reality, but it is a mode which is distinct from the
reality itself of the corporeal substance. Aristotle regarded the
distinction as real. In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Metaphysics</span></span> he declares that the
three dimensions of bodies are quantities, not substances, that
quantity is not a substance, whereas that in which it ultimately
inheres is a substance;<a id="noteref_357" name="noteref_357" href="#note_357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a> in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Physics</span></span> he says that substance is

is directly perceptible by the senses (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensibile</span></em> per se) while substance
is only indirectly perceptible (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensibile</span></em> per accidens):<a id="noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href="#note_360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">360</span></span></a>
from which it is inferred that substance and extension cannot be
really identical. Again, St. Thomas argues that a corporeal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
substance as such, and so far as its essence is concerned, is
indifferent to greater or less extension in space, that the whole
nature or substance of a man, for instance, is indifferent to, and
independent of, his particular size at any point of time, that
while he grows from childhood to manhood it is his external
quantity that changes, but not his humanity, his human essence,
nature, or substance.<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a>

Considerations such as these, though they do not indeed
amount to cogent proofs of a real distinction between spatial
extension and corporeal substance, should make any serious
philosopher hesitate to identify these absolutely, as Descartes and
his followers did when they declared the essence of corporeal
substance to consist in three dimensions of spatial extension.
Even looking at the matter from the point of view of natural
reason alone, and apart altogether from any light that may be
thrown upon it for the Christian philosopher by Divine Revelation,
it is only the superficial thinker who will conclude that
because extension—which reveals to his intellect through the
medium of external sense perception the presence of a corporeal
substance—is naturally inseparable from the latter, therefore it
is really and absolutely identical with this latter. The philosopher
who remembers how little is known for certain about the
ultimate, essential constitution of bodies or corporeal substances,
will be slow to conclude that the spatially extended mode of
their being enters into the constitution of their essence, and is
not rather an accidental determination whereby these substances
have their integral parts dispersed or extended in space and thus
revealed to the human intellect through sense perception.

And if he be a Christian philosopher he will naturally inquire whether
any truth of the Christian Revelation will help indirectly to determine the
question. Descartes and his followers were Christian philosophers; and
hence it was all the more rash and imprudent of them, in spite of what they
knew concerning the Blessed Eucharist, to identify the corporeal substance
with its spatial extension. They knew that by transubstantiation the bread
and wine are changed </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">substantially</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> into the Body and Blood of Christ. But
all the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">appearances</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> or </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">phenomena</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of bread and wine remain after transubstantiation,
the Eucharistic </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">species</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> as they are called, the taste, colour, form,

the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">substances</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> disappear, and from the manifest fact that all their </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">accidents</span></em>

remain, Christian philosophers and theologians have rightly drawn the
sufficiently obvious inference that the spatially extended quantity, which
immediately supports all the other sensible qualities, must be itself an </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">absolute</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
accident not only </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">really distinct</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, but by the absolute power of God </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">really
separable</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, from its </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">connatural substance</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, the bread and the wine respectively;
and that this extended quantity remains in this state of actual separation
miraculously supported by the direct influence of the Divine Omnipotence.
And while Christian philosophers who hold this view can defend it from all
charges of inconsistency, unreasonableness and impossibility, Descartes and
his followers can defend their particular view only by the admission that in
the case of the consecrated Eucharist our senses are deceived. In this view,
while no accidents of the bread and wine remain objectively, God Himself
produces directly in our minds the subjective, mental states which the bread
and wine produced before consecration.</span><a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> This gratuitous aspersion is cast
on the trustworthiness of sense perception, simply on account of the preconceived
theory identifying the corporeal substance with its extension.
According to the common view, on the other hand, the senses are not really
deceived. That to which they testify is really there, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">viz.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> the whole collection
of natural accidents of bread and wine. It is not the function of the senses,
but of the intellect, to testify to the presence of the substance. Of course
the unbeliever looking at the consecrated species, or the believer who looks
at them not knowing that they have been consecrated, thinks that the substance
of bread and the substance of wine are there. Each is deceived
intellectually, the one by his unbelief of a truth, the other by his ignorance of
a fact. If both knew of the fact of consecration, and if the former believed
in the effect of it, neither would be deceived.</span><a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href="#note_363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
While the Cartesian view is thus open to such serious objections, the
only plausible difficulty against the traditional view is that of conceiving how
the reality of a merely accidental mode of being, such as extension, can be
sustained in the actual order of things apart from its connatural substance,
and yet not become itself </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">eo ipso</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> a substance. Needless to say we have no
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">positive</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> conception of the manner in which the Divine Omnipotence thus
sustains extension; but since this latter, being an absolute accident, and not
a mere modal determination of the substance, has a reality of its own, the
miraculous persistence of this reality cannot be shown to be impossible. Nor
is it, in this separated condition, itself a substance, for it still retains its natural
aptitude for inherence in its connatural substance; and this </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">aptitude</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> alone,
not </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actual</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> inherence, is of its essence as an accident (</span><a href="#Section_65" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">65</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">): retaining this
natural aptitude it cannot possibly become a substance, it cannot be identified
with the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">substantial</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> mode of being which has essentially the very
opposite aptitude, that of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">existing in itself</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.

External extension, then, is an absolute accident, really
distinct from the corporeal substance, and naturally though not
absolutely inseparable from the latter. It is the natural concomitant
or consequence of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal quantity</span></em> whereby the
corporeal substance has in itself a plurality of distinct integral
parts. This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal quantity</span></em> itself is either an aspect of the
corporeal substance itself, only virtually distinct from the latter,
or else in the strict sense a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">property</span></em>, absolutely inseparable, if
really distinct, from the substance. Natural experience furnishes
no example of a corporeal substance actually existing devoid of
internal quantity or internal distinction of integral parts.<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a> But
scholastic philosophers are not agreed as to whether the corporeal
substance is itself and by its own essence a manifold of really
distinct integral parts (in which case internal quantity would be
merely the aspect under which the essence is thus regarded as
an integral whole constituted by a plurality of distinct integral
parts; while, looked at as an essence, it would be an essential
whole constituted by the union of two essential parts or principles)—or
whether it is formally constituted an integral whole,
not by its essence (which makes it only an essential whole, an
essentially composite substance), but by a property really distinct,
though necessarily flowing, from this essence, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> internal
quantity. According to the former view the material principle
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia prima</span></span>) of the composite corporeal substance is such
that the essence resulting from its union with the formative
principle (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span>) is necessarily an integral whole
with distinguishable integral parts, each of which naturally demands
the spatially extended mode of being which external
extension <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> confers upon it. According to the latter
view, which is that of St. Thomas and his followers generally,
the corporeal substance as such has no mode of composition
other than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> composition: it is not of itself an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">integral</span></em>
whole, compounded of distinct or distinguishable integral parts
(each of which would be, like the whole, essentially composite):
of itself it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indivisible</span></em> into integral parts: it is, therefore, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this order of being, simple and not composite. It has, no doubt,
by reason of its material principle, an absolutely necessary
exigence for divisibility into distinct integral parts, for integral
composition in other words. But this actual integral composition,
this actual divisibility, is the formal effect of a property
really distinct from the substantial essence itself; and this
property is internal quantity: the connatural, but absolutely
separable, complement of this internal quantity being, as in the
other view, local or spatial extension.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In both views external extension is an absolute accident of
the corporeal substance; and in the Thomist view internal

It is instructive to reflect how far this scholastic doctrine removes us
from the Cartesian view which sets up an absolute antithesis between mind
or spirit, and matter or body, placing the essence of the former in </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">thought</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
and that of the latter in </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">extension</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. According to the scholastic view the
spiritual substance is an immaterial </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">actuality</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> or </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">form</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">; it is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">essentially
simple</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, and not like a corporeal substance an </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">essentially composite</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> substance
resulting from the union of a formative principle or </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">form</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> with a passive,
determinable, material principle. And since it is the material principle that
demands the property of internal quantity and the accident of external
extension, whereby the corporeal substance becomes an integral whole with its
parts extended in space, it follows that the spiritual substance, having no
material principle in its constitution, is not only </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">essentially</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> simple—to the
exclusion of distinct principles of its essence,—but is also and as a consequence
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">integrally</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> simple, to the exclusion of distinct integral parts, and of the
extended or characteristically corporeal mode of occupying space. So far
there is contrast between the two great substantial modes of finite being,
matter and spirit; but the contrast is by no means an absolute antithesis.
For if we look at the essence alone of the corporeal substance it is not </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">of itself</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
actually extended in space: in the Thomist view it is not even of itself divisible
into distinct integral parts. It differs from spirit in this that while the latter is
essentially simple the former is essentially composite and has by reason of this
compositeness a natural aptitude for divisibility into parts and for the extension
of these parts in space, an aptitude which spirit does not possess. But
the corporeal substance </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">may</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> exist without actual extension, and consequently
without any of those other attributes such as impenetrability, solidity, colour,
etc., through which it is perceptible to our senses. In this condition, how
does it differ from spirit? In being essentially composite, and in being
perhaps endowed with distinguishable integral parts.</span><a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href="#note_365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> But in this condition the

the mode in which spirit exists in space: it is related to space somewhat in the
manner in which the soul is in the space occupied by the body—whole in the
whole of this space and whole in every assignable portion of this space. So
that after all, different as matter and spirit undoubtedly are, the difference
between them is by no means that sort of Cartesian chasm which human
thought must for ever fail to bridge.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By virtue of its external extension the corporeal substance exists
by having distinguishable parts outside parts in space. We can
conceive any perceptible volume of matter as being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfectly
continuous</span></em>, if it has no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> limits or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> distinction of parts
within itself, but is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> individual being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">completely filling</span></em> the whole
space within its outer surface; or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imperfectly continuous</span></em>, if while
being one and undivided it has within its volume pores or interstices,
whether these be empty or filled with some other
sort of matter; or as made up of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contiguous</span></em> integral parts if each
or these is really distinct and actually divided from every other,
while each actually touches with its outer limits the adjacent
limits of the parts lying next to it, so that all the internal parts
or limits are co-terminous; or as made up of separate, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discrete</span></em> or
distant parts no one of which actually touches any other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is clear that there must be, in any actually extended
volume of matter, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ultimate</span></em> parts which are really <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">continuous</span></em>—unless
we are to hold, with dynamists, that our perception of
extension is produced in our minds by the action of extramental
points or centres of force which are themselves <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simple</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unextended</span></em>.
But the physical phenomena of contraction, expansion,
absorption, undulatory and vibratory motions accompanying our
sensations of light, heat and sound, as well as many other physical
phenomena, all point to the fact that volumes of matter which
are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apparently</span></em> continuous are really porous: the molecular
structure of perceptible matter is an accepted physical theory;
and scientists also universally accept as a working hypothesis the
existence of an imperceptible material medium pervading and
filling all real space, though there is no agreement as to the properties
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with which they suppose this hypothetical medium, the
<span class="tei tei-q">“ether,”</span> to be endowed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, as regards the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divisibility</span></em> of extended matter, it is
obvious that if we conceive extension in three dimensions
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">geometrically</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mathematically</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the abstract</span></em>, any such volume
or extension is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indefinitely divisible</span></em> in thought. But if we inquire
how far any concrete, actually existing volume of matter is
divisible, we know in the first place that we cannot divide the
body of any actual organic living thing indefinitely without destroying
its life, and so its specific character. Nor can we carry
on the division of inorganic matter indefinitely for want of sufficiently
delicate dividing instruments. But apart from this the
science of chemistry points to the fact that every inorganic chemical
compound has an ultimate individual unit, the chemical molecule,
which we cannot sub-divide without destroying the specific nature
of the compound by resolving it into its elements or into less
complex compounds. Furthermore, each <span class="tei tei-q">“elementary”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“chemically simple”</span> body—such as gold, oxygen, carbon, etc.—seems
resolvable into units called <span class="tei tei-q">“atoms,”</span> which appear to be
ultimate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individual</span></em> units in the sense that if their mass <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> be
subdivided (as appears possible from researches that have originated
in the discovery of radium) the subdivisions are specifically
different kinds of matter from that of the atom so divided.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the inorganic world the perceptible mass of matter is certainly
not an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individual</span></em> being, a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">unum per se</span></span>, but only a collection
of individual atoms or molecules, a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">unum per accidens</span></span>. Whether
the molecule or the atom of the chemically elementary body is
the <span class="tei tei-q">“individual,”</span> cannot be determined with any degree of certitude.
It would appear, however, that every specifically distinct
type of inorganic matter, whether compound or elementary, requires
for its existence a certain minimal volume, by the sub-division of
which the type is substantially changed; and this is manifestly
true of organic or living matter: so that matter <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as it naturally
exists</span></em> would appear not to be indefinitely divisible.

84. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Place and Space.</span></span>—From the concept of the volume or
actual extension of a body we pass immediately to that of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“place”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">locus</span></span>) which it occupies. We may distinguish between
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external</span></em> place of a body. By the former we
understand <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the outer (convex) surface of the body itself, regarded as
a receptacle containing the volume of the body</span></em>. If, therefore, there
were only one body in existence it would have its own internal
place: this is independent of other bodies. Not so, however,
the external place; for by the external place of a body we mean
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the immediately surrounding (concave) surface</span></em>, formed by the bodies
which circumscribe the body in question, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">considered formally
as an immovable container of this body</span></em>. This is a free rendering
of Aristotle's definition: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Place is the first (or immediate) immovable
surface (or limit) of that which contains a body</span></em>: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">prima

filled with water, the inner or concave surface of the sphere would
be the <span class="tei tei-q">“external place”</span> of the water. Not, however, this surface
considered materially, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally as a surface</span></em>, so that if the
sphere could be removed, and another instantaneously substituted
for it, the water would still be contained within the same <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em>
surface; its <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">locus externus</span></span> would remain the same. And, again,
it is the containing surface considered as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immovable</span></em> or as circumscribing
that definite portion of space, that constitutes the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">locus
externus</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“external place”</span> of the located body: so that if the
sphere with the water were moved the latter would thereby obtain
a new external location, for though the containing surface be
still materially and formally the same, it is no longer the same
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a locating</span></em> surface, seeing that it now marks off a portion of
space different from that marked off by it before it was moved.

Regarded ontologically, the internal place of a body is an absolute
accident: it is the accident which gives the latter concrete
volume or external extension, and it is not really distinct from
the latter. The external place of a body includes in addition the
spatial relations of the latter to other bodies, relations grounded
in the volumes of those bodies.

The local presence of a finite being to other finite beings is itself a positive
perfection—based on its actual extension if it be an extended corporeal substance,
or on its power of operating within a certain space if it be a spiritual substance.
The fact that in the case of a finite being this local presence is itself
limited, is at once a corollary and an index of the finiteness of the being in question.
Only the Infinite Being is omnipresent or ubiquitous. But every finite
being, whether corporeal or spiritual, from the very fact that it exists at all,
must exist somewhere or have some </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">locus internus</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, and it must have some

the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">local presence</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of a being is a (finite) perfection which seems to be

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the concept of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">place</span></em> we pass naturally to the more complex
and abstract notion of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">space</span></em>. It is, of course, by cognitive
processes, both sentient and intellectual, that we come into possession
of the abstract concept of space. These processes are subjective
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the sense that they are processes of the individual's mental
faculties. Distinguishing between the processes and the object
or content which is brought into consciousness, or put in presence
of the mind, by means of them; and assuming that this object
or content is not a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mere</span></em> form or groove of our cognitive activity,
not a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mere</span></em> antecedent condition requisite on the mental side for
the conscious exercise of this activity on its data, but that on the
contrary it is, or involves, an objective, extramental reality apprehended
by the mind,—we go on to inquire in what this objective
reality consists. In approaching the question we must first note
that what is true of every abstract and universal concept is true
of the concept of space, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstractness</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universality</span></em>
(<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">intentio universalitatis</span></span>”</span>) of real being, as apprehended by the
intellect, are modes or forms of thought, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span>, logical
conditions and relations which are created by thought, and which
exist only in and for thought; while the reality itself is the object
apprehended in these modes and under these conditions:
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Universale est formaliter in mente et fundamentaliter in re</span></span>. Now
through the concept of space we apprehend a reality. Our concept
of real space has for its object an actual reality. What is
this reality? If space is real, in what does its reality consist?
We answer that the reality which we apprehend through this
concept is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the total amount of the actual extension or magnitude
of all created and coexisting bodies</span></em>; not, however, this total magnitude
considered absolutely and in itself, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as endowed with
real and mutual relations of all its parts to one another</span></em>,<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370" href="#note_370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a> relations
which are apprehended by us as distances, linear, superficial, and
voluminal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such, then, is the reality corresponding to our concept of real
and actual space. But no sooner have we reached this concept
than we may look at its object in the abstract, remove mentally
all limits from it, and conceive all extended bodies as actually
non-existent. What is the result? The result is that we have
now present to our minds the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possibility</span></em> of the existence of extended
bodies, and a concomitant imagination image (which memory
will not allow us to banish from consciousness) of a vast
and boundless emptiness, an indefinite and unmeasurable vacuum
in which bodies were or may be. The intellectual concept is
now not a concept of any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em> object, but of a mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possibility</span></em>:
the possibility of a corporeal, extended universe. This is the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
concept of what we call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideal</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possible space</span></em>; and like the
concept of any other possible reality it is derived by us from
our experience of actual reality,—in this case from our experience
of extended bodies as actually existing. The corporeal universe
has not existed from all eternity, but it was possible from all
eternity. When we think of that possibility as antecedent to
all creation, we are thinking of bodies, and of their extension, as
possible; and the concept of their total extension as possible is the
concept of ideal or possible space. This concept is, through a psychological
necessity, accompanied by an imagination image of what
we call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imaginary space</span></em>: the unlimited vacuity which preceded
corporeal creation, which would still persist were the latter totally
annihilated, which reaches out indefinitely beyond its actual limits,
which imagination pictures for us as a receptacle in which bodies
may exist but which all the time our reason assures us is actually
nothing, being really only the known possibility of corporeal
creatures. This familiar notion of an empty receptacle for bodies
is what we have in mind when we think of bodies as existing <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>
space”</span>. Hence we say that space, as conceived by the human
mind, is not a mere subjective form of cognition, a mere <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span>,
inasmuch as our concept has a foundation in reality, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the actual
extension of all existing bodies; nor is it on the other hand simply
a real entity, because this actual extension of bodies does not
really exist in the manner in which we apprehend it under the
abstract concept of space, as a mere possibility, or empty receptacle,
of bodies. Space is therefore an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis cum fundamento
in re</span></span>.

A great variety of interesting but abstruse questions arise from the consideration

Theology. For example: Is real space actually infinite in magnitude, or

merely one star </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">plus</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> its planets and their satellites,—is there in existence an
actually infinite multitude of such stellar worlds? It is not likely that this
can ever be determined empirically. Many philosophers maintain that the
question must be answered in the negative, inasmuch as an actually infinite
multitude is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">impossible</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. Others, however, deny that the impossibility of an

these limits actually (or even necessarily) filled with an all-pervading ether

space were full of impenetrable matter? How would the real interaction of
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
distant bodies on one another be possible if there were only vacant space
between them? Is the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">real</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> volume or extension of a corporeal substance (as
distinct from its </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">apparent</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> volume, which is supposed to include interstices, or
spaces not filled with that body) actually or necessarily unchangeable? Or
is the internal quantity of a body actually or necessarily unchangeable?
Can more than one individual corporeal substance simultaneously occupy exactly
the same space? (This is not possible naturally, for impenetrability is
a natural consequence of local extension; but it is possible miraculously—if
all the bodies, or all except one, be miraculously deprived of local or spatial
extension.) Can the same individual body be present at the same time in
totally different and distant places? (Not naturally, of course; but how it
can happen even miraculously is a more difficult question than the preceding
one. It is in virtue of its actual or local extension that a body is present
sensibly in a definite place. Deprived miraculously of this extension it can
be simultaneously in several places, as our Blessed Lord's Body is in the
Eucharist. But if a body has its natural local extension at one definite place,
does this extension so confine its presence to this place that it cannot be simultaneously
present—miraculously, and without its local extension—at other
places? The most we can say is that the absolute impossibility of this is
neither self-evident nor capable of cogent proof. The Body of our Lord has
its natural local extension in heaven—for heaven, which will be the abode of
the glorified bodies of the blessed after the general resurrection, must be not
merely a state or condition, but a place—and at the same time it is sacramentally
present in many places on earth.)

85. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Time: its Apprehension and Measurement.</span></span>—If the
concept of space is difficult to analyse, and gives rise to some
practically insoluble problems, this is still more true of the concept
of time. <span class="tei tei-q">“What, then, is time?”</span> exclaims St. Augustine
in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Confessions</span></span>.<a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372" href="#note_372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“If no one asks me, I know; but if I am
asked to explain it, then I do not know!”</span> We reach the
notion of space through our external perception of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extension</span></em>
by the senses of sight and touch. So also we derive the notion
of time from our perception of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motion</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em>, and mainly from
our consciousness of change and succession in our own conscious
states. The concept of time involves immediately two other concepts,
that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">duration</span></em>, and that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">succession</span></em>. Duration, or continuance
in existence, is of two kinds, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">permanent</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">successive</span></em>.
Permanent duration is the duration of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immutable</span></em> being,
formally and in so far as it is immutable. Successive duration
is the continued existence or duration of a being that is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subject</span></em> to change, formally and in so far as it is mutable. Now
real change involves a continuous <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">succession</span></em> of real states, it is a
continuous <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">process</span></em> or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fieri</span></span>; and it is the duration of a being subject
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to such change that we call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">temporal duration</span></em>. Had
we no consciousness of change, or succession of states, we could
have no notion of time; though we might have a notion of unchanging
duration if <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per impossibile</span></span> our cognitive activity were itself
devoid of any succession of conscious states and had for its
object only unchanging reality. But since our cognitive activity
is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> successive we can apprehend permanent or unchanging
duration, not as it is in itself, but only after the analogy of successive
or temporal duration (<a href="#Section_86" class="tei tei-ref">86</a>). The continuous series of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">successive states involved in change</span></em> is, therefore, the real and objective
content of our notion of time; just as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">co-existing</span></em> total
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extension</span></em> forms the content of our notion of space. The concept
of space is the concept of something static; that of time is
the concept of something kinetic. Time is the continuity of
change: where there is change there is time; without change
time would be inconceivable. Change involves succession, and
succession involves the temporal elements of <span class="tei tei-q">“before”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“after,”</span> separated by the indivisible limiting factor called the
<span class="tei tei-q">“now”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“present instant”</span>. The <span class="tei tei-q">“past”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“future”</span>
are the two <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">parts</span></em> of time, while the <span class="tei tei-q">“present instant”</span> is not a
part of time, but a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">point of demarcation</span></em> at which the future flows
into the past. Change is a reality; it is a real mode of the existence
of mutable things; but neither the immediately past
state, nor the immediately future state of a changing reality, are
actual at the present instant: it is only to the permanent, abiding
mind, apprehending real change, and endowed with memory and
expectation, that the past and the future are actually (and, of
course, only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideally</span></em>, not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em>) present. And it is only by
holding past and future in present consciousness, by distinguishing
mentally between them, by counting or measuring the continuous
flow of successive states from future to past, through the
present instant, that the mind comes into possession of the concept
of time.<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href="#note_373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a> The mind thus apprehends time as the measure
of the continuous flow of successive states in things subject to
change. As thus apprehended, time is not merely the reality of
change: it is the successive continuity or duration of change considered
as a measure of change. It is that within which all changes
are conceived to happen: just as space is conceived as that within
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which all extended things are conceived to exist. We have said
that without real change or motion there could be no time. We
can now add that without a mind to apprehend and measure
this motion there could be no time. As St. Thomas declares,
following Aristotle: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Si non esset anima non esset tempus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374" href="#note_374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a> For
time, as apprehended by means of our abstract and universal
concept, is not simply a reality, but a reality endowed with logical
relations, or, in other words, a logical entity grounded in reality,
an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis cum fundamento in re</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This brings us to Aristotle's classic definition,<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href="#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a> which is at
once pithy and pregnant: Τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν ὁ χρόνος, ἀριθμὸς κινήσεως
κατὰ τὸ πρότερον καὶ ὓστερον: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempus est numerus motus
secundum prius et posterius</span></span>: Time is the measure of motion or
change by what we conceive as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">future</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">past</span></em>,
in its process. Every change involves its own intrinsic flow of
states from future to past. It is by mentally distinguishing these
states, and by thus computing, counting, numbering, the continuous
flow or change, that we derive from the latter the notion
of time.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a> If, then, we consider all created things, all things
subject to change, we shall realize that real time commenced
with the creation of the first of them and will continue as long as
they (or any of them) continue to exist. We thus arrive at a
conception of time in general, analogous to that of space: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
whole continuous series of successions, in changing things, from
future to past, regarded as that in which these changes occur, and
which is the measure of them</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here, too, as in the case of space, we can distinguish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real
time</span></em>, which is the total duration of actual changes, from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideal or
imaginary time</span></em> which is the conceived and imagined duration of
merely possible changes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But a more important distinction is that between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal time</span></em>, or the duration of any concrete mutable reality considered
in itself, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external time</span></em>, which is some other
extrinsic temporal duration with which we compare, and by which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we may measure, the former duration. Every change or motion
has its own internal time; and this is what we have been so far endeavouring
to analyse. If two men start at the same instant to walk
in the same direction, and if one walk three miles and the other
four, while the hands of a watch mark the lapse of an hour, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external
time</span></em> of each walk will be the same, will coincide with one and
the same motion of the hands of the watch used as a measure. But
the internal time of the four-mile walk will be greater than that
of the three-mile walk. The former will be a greater amount of
change than the latter; and therefore its internal time, estimated
by this amount absolutely, will be greater than that of the latter
estimated by its amount absolutely.<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a> The greater the amount of
a change the greater the internal time-duration or series of
successive states which measures this change absolutely.<a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href="#note_378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">378</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Just as the category <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Where</span></em> is indicated by the spatial relations
of a body to other bodies, so the category <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">When</span></em> is indicated,
in regard to any event or process, by its commensuration
or comparison with other events or processes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This brings us to the notion of measurement. To measure
anything quantitatively is to apply to it successively some
quantitative unit taken as a standard and to count the number
of times it contains this unit. This is a process of mentally
breaking up continuous quantity or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">magnitude</span></em>—whether permanent
or successive, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> whether extension or motion—into
discontinuous quantity or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">multitude</span></em>. If the measurement of
permanent quantity by spatial units, and the choosing of such
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
units, are difficult processes,<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a> those of measuring successive
quantity and fixing on temporal units are more difficult still. Is
there any natural motion or change of a general character, whereby
we can measure (externally) the time-duration of all other
changes? The motions of the earth itself—on its axis and
around the sun—at once suggest themselves. And these motions
form in fact the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></em> general standard for measuring the time
of all other events in the universe. All <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">artificial</span></em> or mechanical
devices, such as hour-glasses, watches, clocks, chronometers, etc.,
are simply contrivances for the more convenient application of
that general and natural standard to all particular events.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It requires a little reflection to realize that all our means of
measuring time-duration can only attain to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">approximate</span></em> accuracy,
inasmuch as our faculties of sense perception, no matter by what
devices they are aided, are so limited in range and penetration
that fluctuations which fall below the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">minima sensibilia</span></span> cannot
be detected. It is a necessary condition of any motion used as a
standard for time-measurement that it be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regular</span></em>. That the
standard motions we actually employ are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em> regular we
have no guarantee. We can test their regularity only up to the
point at which our power of detecting irregularity fails.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Reflection will also show that our appreciation of time-duration
is also <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relative</span></em>, not absolute. It is always a comparison
of one flow or current of conscious experiences with another.
It is the greater regularity of astronomical motions, as compared
with changes or processes experienced as taking place
within ourselves, that causes us to fix on the former as the more
suitable standard for the measurement of time. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is indeed,”</span>
writes Father Maher,<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“a certain rhythm in many of the processes
of our organic life, such as respiration, circulation, and the recurrent
needs of food and sleep, which probably contribute much
to our power of estimating duration.... The irregular character
and varying duration of conscious states, however, soon bring
home to us the unfitness of these subjective phenomena to serve
as a standard measure of time.”</span> Moreover, our estimate of
duration is largely dependent on the nature of the estimated
experiences and of our mental attitude towards them: <span class="tei tei-q">“A period
with plenty of varied incident, such as a fortnight's travel, passes
rapidly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at the time</span></em>. Whilst we are interested in each successive
experience we have little spare attention to notice the duration
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the experience. There is almost complete lapse of the
<span class="tei tei-q">‘enumerating’</span> activity. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in retrospect</span></em> such a period expands,
because it is estimated by the number and variety of the impressions
which it presents to recollection. On the other hand
a dull, monotonous, or unattractive occupation, which leaves much
of our mental energy free to advert to its duration, is over-estimated
whilst taking place. A couple of hours spent impatiently
waiting for a train, a few days in idleness on board ship, a week
confined to one's room, are often declared to constitute an <span class="tei tei-q">‘age’</span>.
But when they are past such periods, being empty of incident,
shrink up into very small dimensions.... Similarly, recent intervals
are exaggerated compared with equal periods more remote.
Whilst as we grow older and new experiences become fewer and
less impressive, each year at its close seems shorter than its predecessor.”</span><a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href="#note_381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">381</span></span></a>

universe were to be suddenly and simultaneously altered in the same direction—all

for instance, that the rate of motion were doubled, the same amount of change

or comparative</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> time of all movements—that is to say, the time of which alone we
can have any appreciation—would be the same as of old. The new day would,
of course, appear only half as long as the old to a mind not readjusted to
the new conditions; but this would still be external time. But would the
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">internal</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> time of each movement be unaltered? It would be the
same for the readjusted mind as it was previously for the mind adjusted to
these previous conditions. By an unaltered mind, however, by the Divine
Mind, for instance, the same amount of motion would be seen to constitute
the same movement under both conditions, but to take place twice as quickly
under the new conditions as it did under the old. This again, however, involves
a comparison, and thus informs us merely of external or relative time. If we
identify intrinsic time with </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">amount of change</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, making the latter the measure

not alter its absolute time: and this is evident when we reflect that the very
notion of a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">rate</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of motion involves the comparison of the latter with some

Besides the question of the relativity of time, there are many other curious

alone whether or not it </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">must</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> have had a beginning? The greatest philosophers

such by the Divine Mind, contains virtually the Divine exemplars of an infinite
multitude of possible creatures. Those who defend the possibility of an actually
infinite multitude of creatures consider this fact of the infinite imitability of the
Divine Essence as the ground of this possibility. On the other hand, those
who hold that an actually infinite multitude is self-contradictory deny the
validity of this argument from possibility to actuality; and they bring forward
such serious considerations and arguments in favour of their own view that this
latter has been at all times much more commonly advocated than the former

86. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Duration of Immutable Being: Eternity.</span></span>—We
have seen that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">duration</span></em> is the perseverance or continuance of a
being in its existence. The duration of the Absolutely Immutable
Being is a positive perfection identical with the essence itself of
this Being. It is a duration without beginning, without end,
without change or succession, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">permanent</span></em> as distinct from a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">successive</span></em> duration, for it is the duration of the Necessary Being,
whose essence is Pure Actuality. This duration is eternity:
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an interminable duration existing all together</span></em>. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Aeternitas est interminabilis

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or necessary eternity. The word <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">interminabilis</span></span>”</span> connotes
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positive</span></em> perfection: the exclusion of beginning and end. The
word <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tota</span></span>”</span> does not imply that the eternity has parts. The
expression <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tota simul</span></span>”</span> excludes the imperfection which is
characteristic of time duration, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">succession</span></em> of <span class="tei tei-q">“before”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“after”</span>. The definition given by Boëtius<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href="#note_387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">387</span></span></a> emphasizes these
points, as also the indefectible character of immutable life in
the Eternal Being: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Aeternitas est interminabilis vitae tota simul et
prefecta possessio</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is, in the next place, a kind of duration which has been
called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hypothetical</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relative</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">borrowed</span></em> eternity: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">aeternitas

It is the duration in existence of a being that is contingent,
but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of its nature incorruptible, immortal</span></em>, such as the
human soul or a pure spirit. Even if such a being existed from
all eternity its existence would be contingent, dependent on a
real principle distinct from itself: its duration, therefore, would
not be eternity in the strict sense. On the other hand, once
created by God, its nature would demand conservation without
end; nor could it naturally cease to exist, though absolutely
speaking it could cease to exist were God to withdraw from it
His conserving power. Its duration, therefore, differs from the
duration of corporeal creatures which are by nature subject to
change, decay, and cessation of their being. A contingent
spiritual substance has by nature a beginning to its duration, or at
least a duration which is not essential to it but dependent on the
Necessary Being, a duration, however, which is naturally without
end; whereas the duration of the corporeal being has by nature
both a beginning and an end.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
But philosophers are not agreed as to the nature and ground of the
distinction between these two kinds of duration in contingent beings. No
contingent being is self-existent, neither has any contingent being the principle
of its own duration in its own essence. Just as it cannot begin to exist of itself,
so neither can it continue to exist of itself. At the same time, granted that it
has obtained from God actual existence, some kind or degree of duration, of
continuance in that existence, seems to be naturally due to its essence. Otherwise
conservation would be not only really but formally a continued creation.
It is such indeed on the part of God: in God there is no variety of activity.
But on the part of the creature, the preservation of the latter in existence, and
therefore some degree of duration, seems to be due to it on the hypothesis
that it has been brought into existence at all. The </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">conserving</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> influence of
God is to its duration in existence what the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">concurring</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> influence of God is to

existence is a positive perfection which we may regard as a property of its
nature. But is this perfection or property of the creature which we call

And (</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">b</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">) is it really identical with their actual existence (or with the reality of
whatever change or actualization occurs to their existence), or it is a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">mode</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of
this existence or change, really distinct from the latter and conferring upon
the latter the perfection of continuity or persistence?
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
This, at all events, is universally admitted: that </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">we</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> cannot become aware
of any duration otherwise than through our apprehension of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">change</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">; that we
have direct knowledge only of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">successive</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> duration; that we can conceive the
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">permanent</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> duration of immutable reality only after the analogy of successive
duration, or as the co-existence of immutable reality with the successive
duration of mutable things.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Now some philosophers identify successive duration with change, and hold
that successive duration is formally the duration of things subject to change;
that in so far as a being is subject to change its duration is successive, and in
so far as it is free from change its duration approaches the essentially permanent
duration of the Eternal, Immutable Being; that therefore the duration
of corporeal, corruptible, mortal beings is </span><span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">par excellence</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> successive or temporal
duration (</span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">tempus</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">); that spiritual beings, which are substantially immutable,
but nevertheless have a successive series of spiritual activities, have a sort of
duration more perfect, because more permanent, than mere temporal duration,
but less perfect, because less permanent, than eternal duration (</span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">aevum</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
</span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">aeviternitas</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">); while the Absolutely Immutable Being alone has perfect permanent
duration (</span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">aeternitas</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">).</span><a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href="#note_389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> It is not clear whether according to this view
we should distinguish between the duration of spiritual </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">substances</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> as permanent,
and that of their </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">acts</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> as successive; or why we should not attribute </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">permanent</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
duration to corporeal </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">substances</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> and their </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">permanent accidents</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, confining
successive duration formally to motion or change itself. It is, moreover,
implied in this view that duration is not any really distinct perfection or mode
superadded to the actuality of the being that endures.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Other philosophers hold that </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">all</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> duration of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">creatures</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">successive</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">; that

no individual creature has a mixture of permanent and successive duration;
that this successive duration is really distinct from that which endures by
means of it; that it is really distinct even from the reality of change or motion
itself; that it is a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">real mode</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> the formal function of which is to confer on the
enduring reality a series of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actualities in the order of</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">succession of posterior

which their extension confers upon bodies in space). These philosophers
distinguish between </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">continuous</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> or (indefinitely) </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">divisible</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> successive duration,

and indivisible units of duration succeeding one another discontinuously: each
part being a real but indivisible duration, so that besides the parts that are

but which is also—unlike an instant of time—a real duration. The
former kind of successive duration they ascribe to corporeal, corruptible
creatures; the latter to spiritual, incorruptible creatures. This view is defended
with much force and ingenuity by De San in his </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Cosmologia</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">;</span><a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> where

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
87. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Importance of the Present Category.</span></span>—An analysis
of the concept of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Relation</span></em> will be found to have a very direct
bearing both on the Theory of Being and on the Theory of
Knowledge. For the human mind knowledge is embodied in the
mental act of judgment, and this is an act of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">comparison</span></em>, an act
whereby we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relate</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">refer</span></em> one concept to another. The act of
cognition itself involves a relation between the knowing subject
and the known object, between the mind and reality. Reality
itself is understood only by our mentally recognizing or establishing
relations between the objects which make up for us the whole
knowable universe. This universe we apprehend not as a multitude
of isolated, unconnected individuals, but as an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ordered whole</span></em>
whose parts are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inter-related</span></em> by their mutual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">co-ordinations</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subordinations</span></em>. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">order</span></em> we apprehend in the universe results
from these various inter-relations whereby we apprehend it
as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">system</span></em>. What we call a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law of nature</span></em>, for instance, is
nothing more or less than the expression of some constant relation
which we believe to exist between certain parts of this
system. The study of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Relation</span></em>, therefore, belongs not merely to
Logic or the Theory of Knowledge, but also to the Theory of
Being, to Metaphysics. What, then, is a relation? What is
the object of this mental concept which we express by the term
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relation</span></em>? Are there in the known and knowable universe of
our experience <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> relations? Or are all relations <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">merely logical</span></em>,
pure creations of our cognitive activity? Can we classify relations,
whether real or logical? What constitutes a relation formally?
What are the properties or characteristics of relations?
These are some of the questions we must attempt to answer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, there is much ambiguity, and not a little error, in
the use of the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“absolute”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“relative”</span> in modern
philosophy. To some of these sources of confusion we have
referred already (<a href="#Section_5" class="tei tei-ref">5</a>). It is a commonplace of modern philosophy,
a thing accepted as unquestioned and unquestionable, that we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
know, and can know, only the relative. There is a true sense in
this, but the true sense is not the generally accepted one.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Considering the order in which our knowledge of reality progresses
it is unquestionable that we first simply perceive <span class="tei tei-q">“things”</span>
successively, things more or less <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">similar</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dissimilar</span></em>, without
realizing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in what</span></em> they agree or differ. To realize the latter involves
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reflection</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">comparison</span></em>. Similarly we perceive <span class="tei tei-q">“events”</span>
in succession, events some of which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">depend on</span></em> others, but without
at first noting or realizing this dependence. In other words we
apprehend at first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apart from their relations</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as absolute</span></em>, things
and events which are really relative; and we do so spontaneously,
without realizing even that we perceive them as absolute.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The seed needs soil and rain and sunshine for its growth;
but these do not need the seed. The turbine needs the water,
but the water does not need the turbine. When we realize such
facts as these, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by reflection</span></em>, contrasting what is dependent with
what is independent, what is like or unlike, before or after, greater
or less than, other things, with what each of these is in itself,
we come into conscious possession of the notion of <span class="tei tei-q">“the relative”</span>
and oppose this to the notion of <span class="tei tei-q">“the absolute”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What we conceive as dependent we conceive as relative; what
we conceive, by negation, as independent, we conceive as absolute.
Then by further observation and reflection we gradually realize
that what we apprehended as independent of certain things is
dependent on certain other things; that the same thing may be
independent in some respects and dependent in other respects.
The rain does not depend on the seed which it causes to germinate,
but it does depend on the clouds. The water which turns
the turbine does not depend on the turbine, but it does depend
on the rain; and the rain depends on the evaporation of the
waters of the ocean; and the evaporation on the solar heat;
and this again on chemical and physical processes in the sun;
and so on, as far as sense experience will carry us: until we
realize that everything which falls directly within this sense
experience is dependent and therefore relative. Similarly, the
accident of quantity, in virtue of which we pronounce one of
two bodies to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">larger</span></em> than the other, is something <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> as
compared with this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relation</span></em> itself; but as compared with the
substance in which it inheres, it is dependent on the latter, or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relative</span></em> to the latter, while the substance is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em>, or free from
dependence on it. But if substance is absolute as compared
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with accident, in the sense that substance is not dependent on a
subject in which to inhere, but exists <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in itself</span></em>, it is not absolute
in the sense understood by Spinoza, in the sense of existing
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of itself</span></em>, independently of any efficient cause to account for its
origin (<a href="#Section_64" class="tei tei-ref">64</a>). All the substances in the universe of our direct
sense experience are contingent, dependent <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ab alio</span></span>, and therefore
in this sense relative, not absolute.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is the true sense in which relativity is an essential note
of the reality of all the data of the world of our sense experience.
They are all contingent, or relative, or conditioned existences.
And, as Kant rightly taught, this experience forces us inevitably
to think of a Necessary, Absolute, Unconditioned Being, on whom
these all depend. But, as can be proved in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Natural Theology</span></em>
against Kant, this concept is not a mere regulative idea of the
reason, a form of thought whereby we systematize our experience:
it is a concept the object of which is not merely a necessity
of thought but also an objectively existing reality.<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href="#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a>

But in the thought of most modern philosophers relativism, or the

from all this. For positivists, disciples of Auguste Comte (1798-1857), it

our senses, and the laws of resemblance, succession, etc., according to which
they occur. All </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">theological</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> quests for supra-mundane causes and reasons

powers, influences, in the events themselves, as explaining or accounting for
these latter, are according to this theory necessarily futile: the mind must
rest content with a knowledge of the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">positive facts</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of sense, and their
relations. Relativism is thus another name for Positivism.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
For the psychological sensism of English philosophers from Hobbes
[1588-1679] and Locke [1632-1704] down to Mill [1806-73] and Bain
[1818-1903] relativism means that all conscious cognition—which they tend
to reduce to modes and complexes of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">sensation</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">—must be, and can only be, a
cognition of the changing, the transitional, the relative.</span><a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> According to an
extreme form of this theory the mind can apprehend only relations, but not
the terms of any of these relations: it can apprehend nothing as absolute.
Moreover the relations which it apprehends it creates itself. Thus all reality
is reduced to a system of relations. For Mill the supreme category of real
being was </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Sensation</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">: but sensation can be only a feeling of a relation:
thus the supreme category of real being would be </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Relation</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.</span><a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href="#note_393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">393</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
But the main current of relativism is that which has issued from Kant's
philosophy and worked itself out in various currents such as Spencer's
Agnosticism, Hegel's Monism, and Renouvier's Neo-criticism.</span><a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href="#note_394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> The mind
can know only what is related to it, what is present to it, what is in it; not
what is apart from it, distinct from it. The mind cannot know the real
nature of the extramental, nor even if there be an extramental real. Subject
and object in knowledge are really one: individual minds are only self-conscious
phases in the ever-evolving reality of the One Sole Actual
Being.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
These are but a few of the erroneous currents of modern relativism. A
detailed analysis of them belongs to the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Theory of Knowledge</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. But it may
be pointed out here that they are erroneous because they have distorted and
exaggerated certain profound truths concerning the scope and limits of
human knowledge.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
It is true that we have no positive, proper, intuitive knowledge of the
Absolute Being who is the First Cause and Last End of the universe; that
all our knowledge of the nature and attributes of the Infinite Being is
negative, analogical, abstractive. In a certain sense, therefore, He is above
the scope of our faculties; He is Incomprehensible. But it is false to say
that He is Unknowable; that our knowledge of Him, inadequate and imperfect
as it is, is not genuine, real, and instructive, as far as it goes.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Again, a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">distinct</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> knowledge of any object implies </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">defining</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">limiting</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">,
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">distinguishing</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">comparing</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">relating</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">judging</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">; </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">analysing and synthesizing</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
It implies therefore that we apprehend things </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">in relations</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> with other things.
But this supposes an antecedent, if indistinct, apprehension of the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">things</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">
themselves. Indeed we cannot help pronouncing as simply unintelligible the
contention that all knowledge is of relations, and that we can have no
knowledge of things as absolute. How could we become aware of relations
without being aware of the terms related? Spencer himself admits that the
very reasoning whereby we establish the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">relativity of knowledge</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> leads us
inevitably to assert as necessary the existence of the non-relative, the
Absolute:</span><a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href="#note_395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">395</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> a necessity which Kant also recognizes.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Finally, the fact that reality, in order to be known, must be present to
the knowing mind—or, in other words, that knowledge itself is a relation
between object and subject—in no way justifies the conclusion that we
cannot know the real nature of things as they are in themselves, absolutely,
but only our own subjective, mental impressions or representations of the
absolute reality, in itself unknowable.</span><a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href="#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> The obvious fact that any reality
in order to be known must be related to the knowing mind, seems to be
regarded by some philosophers as if it were a momentous discovery. Then,
conceiving the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">thing-in-itself,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> the absolute, as a something standing out
of all relation to mind, they declare solemnly that we cannot know the
absolute: a declaration which may be interpreted either as a mere truism—that
we cannot know a thing without knowing it!—or as a purely gratuitous
assertion, that besides the world of realities which reveal themselves to our
minds there is another world of unattained and unattainable </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">things-in-themselves</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

which are as it were the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">real</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> realities! These philosophers
have yet to show that there is anything absurd or impossible in the view
that there is simply one world of realities—realities which exist absolutely in
themselves apart from our apprehension of them and which in the process
of cognition come into relation with our minds.</span><a id="noteref_397" name="noteref_397" href="#note_397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">397</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> Moreover, if besides this

hypothesis of such a transcendental world is self-contradictory, for even did
it exist we could not think of it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The process of cognition has indeed its difficulties and mysteries. To
examine these, to account for the possibility of truth and error, to analyse
the grounds and define the scope and limits of human certitude, are problems
for the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Theory of Knowledge</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, on the domain of which we are trenching
perhaps too far already in the present context. But at all events to conceive
reality as absolute in the sense of being totally unrelated to mind, and then
to ask: Is reality so transformed in the very process of cognition that the
mind cannot possibly apprehend it or represent it as it really is?—this certainly
is to misconceive and mis-state in a hopeless fashion the main problem of
Epistemology.

88. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Analysis of the Concept of Relation.</span></span>—Relation is
one of those ultimate concepts which does not admit of definition
proper. And like other ultimate concepts it is familiar to
all. Two lines, each measuring a yard, are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">equal</span></em> to each other
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in length</span></em>: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">equality</span></em> is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantitative</span></em> relation. The number 2
is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">half</span></em> of 4, and 4 is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice</span></em> 2: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">half</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">double</span></em> express each a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantitative</span></em> relation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inequality</span></em>. If two twin brothers are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">like</span></em>
each other we have the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitative</span></em> relation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">resemblance</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">similarity</span></em>; if a negro and a European are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unlike</span></em> each other we
have the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitative</span></em> relation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dissimilarity</span></em>. The steam of the
locomotive moves the train: a relation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient causality</span></em>, of
efficient cause to effect. The human eye is adapted to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
function of seeing: a relation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purpose</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">finality</span></em>, of means to
end. And so on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The objective concept of relation thus establishes a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conceptual
unity</span></em> between a pair of things in the domain of some other
category. Like quantity, quality, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passio</span></span>, etc., it is an
ultimate mode of reality as apprehended through human experience.
But while the reality of the other accident-categories
appertains to substances considered absolutely or in isolation
from one another, the reality of this category which we call
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relation</span></em> appertains indivisibly to two (or more) together, so that
when one of these is taken or considered apart from the other
(or others) the relation formally disappears. Each of the other
(absolute) accidents is formally <span class="tei tei-q">“something”</span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">aliquid</span></span>”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“τι”</span>),
whereas the formal function of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relation</span></em> is to refer something <span class="tei tei-q">“to
something”</span> else (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad aliquid</span></span>”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“πρός τι”</span>). The other accidents
formally inhere in a subject, <span class="tei tei-q">“habent <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse in</span></span> subjecto”</span>;
relation, considered formally as such, does not inhere in a
subject, but gives the latter a respect, or bearing, or reference, or
ordination, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">towards</span></em> something else: <span class="tei tei-q">“relatio dat subjecto
respectum vel <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse ad</span></span> aliquid aliud”</span>. The length of each of two
lines is an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> accident of that line, but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relation</span></em> of
equality or inequality is intelligible only of both together.
Destroy one line and the relation is destroyed, though the other
line retains its length absolutely and unaltered. And so of the
other examples just given. Relation, then, considered formally
as such, is not an absolute accident inhering in a subject, but is
a reference of this subject to some other thing, this latter being
called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">term</span></em> of the relation. Hence relation is described by
the scholastics as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ordination or respect or reference of one thing
to another</span></em>: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ordo vel respectus vel habitudo unius ad aliud</span></span>. The
relation of a subject to something else as term is formally not
anything absolute, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">aliquid</span></span>”</span> in that subject, but merely refers
this subject to something else as term, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad aliquid</span></span>”</span>. Hence
Aristotle's designation of relation as <span class="tei tei-q">“πρός τι,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad aliquid</span></span>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“to
or towards something”</span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“We conceive as relations [πρός τι],”</span>
he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“those things whose very entity itself we regard as
being somehow <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of</span></em> other things or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to</span></em> another thing.”</span><a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href="#note_399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">399</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To constitute a relation of whatsoever kind, three elements
or factors are essential: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two extremes</span></em> of the relation, viz. the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subject</span></em> of the relation and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">term</span></em> to which the subject is
referred, and what is called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foundation</span></em>, or basis, or ground,
or reason, of the relation (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fundamentum</span></em> relationis). This latter
is the cause or reason on account of which the subject bears the
relation to its term. It is always something absolute, in the
extremes of the relation. Hence it follows that we may regard
any relation in two ways, either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em> as the actual bond or
link of connexion between the extremes, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fundamentally</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
as in its cause or foundation in these extremes. This is expressed
technically by distinguishing between the relation <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">secundum esse
in</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">secundum esse ad</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> between the absolute entity of its
foundation in the subject and the purely relative entity in which
the relation itself formally consists. Needless to say, the latter,
whatever it is, does not add any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute entity</span></em> to that of either
extreme. But in what does this relative entity itself consist?
Before attempting an answer to this question we must endeavour
to distinguish, in the next section (<a href="#Section_89" class="tei tei-ref">89</a>), between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purely logical</span></em>
relations and relations which are in some true sense <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>. Here
we may note certain corollaries from the concept of relation as
just analysed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Realities of which the objective concept of relation is verified
derive from this latter certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">properties</span></em> or special characteristics.
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> of these is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reciprocity</span></em>: two related extremes are as
such intelligible only in reference to each other: father to son,
half to double, like to like, etc., and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Correlativa se
invicem connotant</span></span>. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> is that things related to one
another are collateral or concomitant in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Correlativa sunt
simul natura</span></span>: neither related extreme is as such naturally
prior to the other. This is to be understood of the relation
only in its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> aspect, not fundamentally. Fundamentally
or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materialiter</span></span>, the cause for instance is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">naturally prior</span></em> to its
effect. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em> is that related things are concomitant
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logically</span></em>, or in the order of knowledge: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Correlativa sunt simul
cognitione</span></span>: a reality can be known and defined as relative to
another reality only by the simultaneous cognition of both
extremes of the relation.

are in themselves pure products of our thought-activity.

And when we compare these logical entities with one another, or
with real entities, the relations thus established by our thought
are all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical relations</span></em>. Finally, it follows from this same imperfection
in our human modes of thought that we sometimes
understand things only by attributing to these certain logical
relations, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> relations which affect not the reality of these things,

In view of the distinction between logical relations and those we shall
presently describe as real relations, and especially in view of the prevalent
tendency in modern philosophy to regard all relations as merely logical, it
would be desirable to classify logical relations and to indicate the ways in
which they are created by, or result from, our thought-processes. We know
of no more satisfactory analysis than that accomplished by St. Thomas Aquinas
in various parts of his many monumental and enduring works. In his </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Commentaries
on the Sentences</span></span><a id="noteref_400" name="noteref_400" href="#note_400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">400</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> he enumerates four ways in which logical relations
arise from our thought-processes. In his </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Quaestiones Disputatae</span></span><a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a>

he reduces these to two: some logical relations, he says, are invented by the
intellect reflecting on its own concepts and are attributed to these concepts;
others arise from the fact that the intellect can understand things only by
relating, grouping, classifying them, only by introducing among them an
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">arrangement</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> or </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">system of relations</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> through which alone it can understand
them, relations which it could only erroneously ascribe to these
things as they really exist, since they are only projected, as it were, into
these things by the mind. Thus, though it consciously thinks of these
things as so related, it deliberately abstains from asserting that these
relations really affect the things themselves. Now the mistake of all
those philosophers, whether ancient, medieval or modern, who deny that
any relations are real, seems to be that they carry this abstention too far.
They contend that all relations are simply read into the reality by our thought;
that none are in the reality in any true sense independently of our thought. They
thus exaggerate the rôle of thought as a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">constitutive</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> factor of known or experienced
reality; and they often do so to such a degree that according to
their philosophy human thought not merely </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">discovers</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> or </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">knows</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> reality but

cognition would be mainly a process whereby reality is assimilated to mind and
not rather a process whereby mind is assimilated to reality. Against all such

real relation is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one which is not a mere product of thought, but
which obtains between real things independently of our thought</span></em>.
For a real relation there must be (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>, individual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subject</span></em>; (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)

from the subject. If the subject of the relation, or its foundation,
be not real, but a mere <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span>, obviously the relation cannot
be more than logical. If, moreover, the term be not a really distinct
entity from the subject, then the relation can be nothing
more than a mental comparison of some thing with itself, either
under the same aspect or under mentally distinct aspects. A relation
is real in the fullest sense when the extremes are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mutually</span></em>
related in virtue of a foundation really existing in both. Hence
St Thomas' definition of a real relation as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">connexion between some
two things in virtue of something really found in both</span></em>: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitudo

Now the question: Are there in the real world, among the
things which make up the universe of our experience, relations
which are not merely logical, which are not a mere product of our
thought?—can admit of only one reasonable answer. That there
are relations which are in some true sense real and independent
of our thought-activity must be apparent to everyone whose
mental outlook on things has not been warped by the specious
sophistries of some form or other of Subjective Idealism. For <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex
professo</span></span> refutations of Idealist theories the student must consult
treatises on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Theory of Knowledge</span></em>. A few considerations on
the present point will be sufficiently convincing here.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, then, let us appeal to the familiar examples mentioned
above. Are not two lines, each a yard long, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really equal</span></em> in
length, whether we know it or not? Is not a line a yard long
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really greater than</span></em> another line a foot in length, whether we
know it or not? Surely our thought does not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">create</span></em> but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discovers</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the equality or inequality. The twin brothers <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really resemble</span></em>
each other, even when no one is thinking of this resemblance;
the resemblance is there whether anyone adverts to it or not.
The motion of the train <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really depends</span></em> on the force of the steam;
it is not our thought that produces this relation of dependence.
The eye is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em> so constructed as to perceive light, and the
light is really such by nature as to arouse the sensation of vision;
surely it is not our thought that produces this relation of mutual
adaptation in these realities. Such relations are, therefore, in
some true sense real and independent of our thought: unless indeed
we are prepared to say with idealists that the lines, the brothers,
the train, the steam, the eye, and the light—in a word, that not
merely relations, but all accidents and substances, all realities—are
mere products of thought, ideas, states of consciousness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">order</span></em> is but a system of relations of co-ordination and
subordination between really distinct things. But there is real
order in the universe. And therefore there are real relations in
the universe. There is real order in the universe: In the physical
universe do we not experience a real subordination of effects to
causes, a real adaptation of means to ends? And in the moral universe
is not this still more apparent? The domestic society, the
family, is not merely an aggregate of individuals any one of whom
we may designate indiscriminately husband or wife, father or
mother, brother or sister. These relations of order are real; they
are obviously not the product of our thought, not produced by
it, but only discovered, apprehended by it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a profound truth that not all the reality of the universe
which presents itself to the human mind for analysis and interpretation,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not all</span></em> the reality of this universe, is to be found in the
mere sum-total of the individual entities that constitute it, considering
these entities each absolutely and in isolation from the
others. Nor does <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> its real perfection consist in the mere sum-total
of the absolute perfections intrinsic to, and inherent in,
those various individual entities. Over and above these individual
entities and their absolute perfections, there is a domain of
reality, and of real perfections, consisting in the real <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adaptation</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interaction</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interdependence</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arrangement</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">co-ordination</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subordination</span></em>,
of those absolute entities and perfections among themselves.
And if we realize this profound truth<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href="#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a> we shall have no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
difficulty in recognizing that, while the thought-processes whereby
we interpret this universe produce logical relations which we
utilize in this interpretation, there is also in this universe itself a
system of relations which are real, which are not invented, but
are merely detected, by our minds.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to idealists, relation is a subjective category of the
mind. It belongs to phenomena only on the introduction of the
latter into the understanding. <span class="tei tei-q">“Laws no more exist in
phenomena,”</span> writes Kant,<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“than phenomena exist in themselves;
the former are relative to the subject in which the phenomena
inhere, in so far as this subject is endowed with understanding;
just as the latter are relative to this same subject in so far as it is
endowed with sensibility.”</span> This is ambiguous and misleading.
Of course, laws or any other relations do not exist <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for us</span></em>, are
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not known</span></em> by us, are not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">brought into relation to our understanding</span></em>,
as long as we do not consciously grasp the two terms and the
foundation on which the law, or any other relation, rests. But
there are relations whose terms and foundations are anterior to,
and independent of, our thought, and which consequently are not
a product of thought.

Distinct from this is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">non-mutual</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mixed</span></em> relation, which

creature to the Creator is a real relation, for the essential dependence
of the creature on the Creator is a relation grounded in
the very nature of the creature as a contingent being. But the
relation of the Creator to the creature is only logical, for the
creative act on which it is grounded implies in the Creator no
reality distinct from His substance, which substance has no
necessary relation to any creature. Similarly, the relation of
the (finite) knowing mind to the known object is a real relation,
for it is grounded in a new quality, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> knowledge, whereby
the mind is perfected. But the relation of the object to the
mind is not a real relation, for by becoming actually known the
object itself does not undergo any real change or acquire any new
reality or perfection. We have seen already (<a href="#Section_42" class="tei tei-ref">42</a>, <a href="#Section_50" class="tei tei-ref">50</a>) that all reality
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transcendental</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> relation to intellect and to will,
ontological truth and ontological goodness. These relations of
reality to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Divine</span></em> Intellect and Will are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em>
verified in all things; whereas the transcendental truth and goodness
of any thing in regard to any created intellect and will are
formal or actual only when that thing is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em> known and willed
by such created faculties: the relations of a thing to a mind that
does not actually know and desire that thing are only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fundamental</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potential</span></em> truth and goodness. This brings us to a
second great division of relations, into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transcendental</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">predicamental</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An essential or transcendental relation is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one which is involved
in the very essence itself of the related thing</span></em>. It enters into and
is inseparable from the concept of the latter. Thus in the concept
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">creature</span></em> as such there is involved an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em> relation
of the latter's dependence on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Creator</span></em>. So, too, every individual
reality involves essential relations of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identity</span></em> with itself and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinction</span></em> from other things, and essential relations of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">goodness</span></em> to the Divine Mind and created minds. Knowledge
involves an essential relation to a known object. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Accidents</span></em> involve
the essential relation of an aptitude to inhere in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substances</span></em>.

ordination or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ordo</span></span>”</span> to something else, there we have an <span class="tei tei-q">“essential”</span>

because it can be verified of a subject in any category; and, since
it adds nothing real to its subject it does not of itself constitute
any new category of real being. Like the logical relation it is
referred to here in order to bring out, by way of contrast, the
accidental or predicamental relation which is the proper subject-matter
of the present chapter.

to the term, while the essential or transcendental relation is
rather an intrinsic attribute or aptitude of the nature itself as a
principle of action, or an effect of action. The real, accidental

one of the ultimate accidental modes of real being. Hence it is

relations that are transcendental.<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href="#note_410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a> He distinguishes<a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href="#note_411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411</span></span></a> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) relations

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) By <span class="tei tei-q">“unity and multitude”</span> he is commonly interpreted
to mean identity or diversity not merely in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantity</span></em>, but in any
<span class="tei tei-q">“formal”</span> factor, and therefore also in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quality</span></em>, and in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em>. Things that are one in quantity we term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">equal</span></em>; one
in quality, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">similar</span></em>; one in substance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identical</span></em>. And if they
are not one in these respects we call them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unequal</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dissimilar</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinct</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">diverse</span></em>, respectively. About quantity as a foundation
for real, predicamental relations there can be no difficulty. Indeed
it is in a certain sense implied in all relations—at least as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apprehended by the human mind. For we apprehend relations,
of whatsoever kind, by mental comparison, and this involves the
consciousness of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">number</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plurality</span></em>, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> things compared.<a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href="#note_412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a>
And when we compare things on the basis of any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quality</span></em> we do
so only by distinguishing and measuring <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intensive grades</span></em> in this
quality, after the analogy of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extensive</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantitative</span></em> measurement
(<a href="#Section_80" class="tei tei-ref">80</a>). Nevertheless just as quality is a distinct accident irreducible
to quantity (<a href="#Section_77" class="tei tei-ref">77</a>), so are relations based on quality different
from those based on quantity. But what about substance or
nature as a foundation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">predicamental</span></em> relations? For these,
as distinct from transcendental relations, some accident really
distinct from the substance seems to be required. The substantial,
individual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identity</span></em> of any real being with itself is only a
logical relation, for there are not two really distinct extremes.
The specific identity of John with James in virtue of their common
human nature is a real relation but it would appear to be
transcendental.<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href="#note_413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a> The relation of the real John and the real
James to our knowledge of them is the transcendental relation of
any reality to knowledge, the relation of ontological truth. This
relation is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essentially</span></em> actual in regard to the Divine mind, but
only potential, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidentally</span></em> actual, in regard to any created
mind (<a href="#Section_42" class="tei tei-ref">42</a>). The relation of real distinction between two individual
substances is a real but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transcendental</span></em> relation, grounded in
the transcendental attribute of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oneness</span></em> which characterizes every
real being (<a href="#Section_26" class="tei tei-ref">26</a>, <a href="#Section_27" class="tei tei-ref">27</a>).

ground of real predicamental relations. If the action is transitive<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href="#note_414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a>
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">patiens</span></span> or recipient of the real change acquires by this latter
the basis of a relation of real dependence on the cause or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">agens</span></span>.
Again, if the action provokes reaction, so that there is real interaction,
each <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">agens</span></span> being also <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">patiens</span></span>, there arises a mutual predicamental
relation of interdependence between the two agencies.
Furthermore, if the agent itself is in any way really perfected by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the action there arises a real predicamental relation which is
mutual: not merely a real relation of effect to agent but also
of agent to effect. This is true in all cases of what scholastics
call <span class="tei tei-q">“univocal”</span> as distinct from <span class="tei tei-q">“equivocal”</span> causation. Of the
former, in which the agent produces an effect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">like in nature to itself</span></em>,
the propagation of their species by living things is the great example.
Here not only is the relation of offspring to parents a
real relation, but that of parents to offspring is also a real relation.
And this real relation is permanent because it is grounded not
merely in the transient generative processes but in some real and
abiding result of these processes—either some physical disposition
in the parents themselves,<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href="#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a> or some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specific</span></em> perfection attributed
by extrinsic denomination to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individual</span></em> parents: the parents
are in a sense continued in their offspring: <span class="tei tei-q">“generation really perpetuates
the species, the specific nature, and in this sense may be
said to perfect the individual parents”</span>.<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href="#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a> In cases of <span class="tei tei-q">“equivocal”</span>
causation—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> where the effect is different in nature from the
cause, as when a man builds a house—the agent does not so
clearly benefit by the action, so that in such cases, while the relation
of the effect to the cause is real, some authors would regard
that of the cause to the effect as logical.<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a> When, however, we
remember that the efficient activity of all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">created</span></em> causes is necessarily
dependent on the Divine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Concursus</span></em>, and necessarily involves
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change in the created cause itself</span></em>, we can regard this change as in
all cases the ground of a real relation of the created cause to its
effect. But the creating and conserving activity of the Divine
Being cannot ground a real relation of the latter to creatures because
the Divine Being is Pure and Unchangeable Actuality,
acquiring no new perfection, and undergoing no real change, by
such activity.<a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href="#note_418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">418</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) By commensuration as a basis of real relations Aristotle
does not mean quantitative measurement, but the determination
of the perfection of one reality by its being essentially conformed
to, and regulated by, another: as the perfection of knowledge or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
science, for instance, is determined by the perfection of its object.
This sort of commensuration, or essential ordination of one
reality to another, is obviously the basis of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transcendental</span></em> relations.
Some authors would consider that besides the transcendental relation
of science to its object, a relation which is independent of the
actual existence of the latter, there also exists an accidental relation
in science to its object as long as this latter is in actual existence.
But rather it should be said that just as the transcendental
truth-relation of any real object to intellect is fundamental
(potential) or formal (actual) according as this intellect merely
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> know this object or actually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></em> know it, so also the transcendental
relation of knowledge to its object is fundamental or
formal according as this object is merely possible or actually
existing.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We gather from the foregoing analysis that the three main
classes of predicamental relations are those based on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quantity</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quality</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causality</span></em>, respectively.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
93. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">In What does the Reality of Predicamental Relations
Consist?</span></span>—We have seen that not all relations are purely
logical. There are real relations; and of these some are not merely
aspects of the other categories of real being, not merely transcendental
attributes virtually distinct from, but really identical
with, these other absolute modes of real being which we designate
as <span class="tei tei-q">“substance,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“quantity,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“quality,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“cause,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“effect,”</span> etc.
There are real relations which form a distinct accidental mode of
real being and so constitute a category apart. The fact, however,
that these predicamental relations have been placed by Aristotle
and his followers in a category apart does not of itself prove that
the predicamental relation is a special reality <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sui generis</span></span>, really
and adequately distinct from the realities which constitute the
other categories (<a href="#Section_60" class="tei tei-ref">60</a>). If the predicamental relation be not a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purely
logical entity</span></em>, if it be an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis cum fundamento in re</span></span>, or, in
other words, if the object of our concept of <span class="tei tei-q">“predicamental relation,”</span>
has a foundation in reality (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> like the concepts of <span class="tei tei-q">“space”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“time”</span>), then it may reasonably be placed in a category apart,
even although it may not be itself formally a reality. We have
therefore to see whether or not the predicamental relation is, or
embodies, any mode of real being adequately distinct from these
modes which constitute the other categories.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The predicamental relation is real in the sense that it implies,
in addition to two really distinct extremes, a real foundation in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
one or both of these extremes, a real accident such as quantity,
quality, or causality. That is to say, considered in its foundation
or cause, considered fundamentally or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">secundum suum esse in subjecto</span></span>,
the predicamental relation is real, inasmuch as its foundation
is a reality independently of the consideration of the mind. No
doubt, if the predicamental relation, adequately considered, implies
no other reality than that of its foundation and terms, then
the predicamental relation does not contain any special reality
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sui generis</span></span>, distinct from substances, quality, quantity, and other
such absolute modes of real being. This, however, does not prevent
its ranking as a distinct category provided it adds a virtually
distinct and altogether peculiar aspect to those absolute
realities. Now, considered adequately, the predicamental relation
adds to the reality it has in its foundation the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual reference</span></em> of
subject to term. In fact, it is in this reference of subject to term,
this <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse ad</span></span>,”</span> that the relation <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em> consists. The question
therefore may be stated thus: Is this formal relation of subject to
term, this <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse ad</span></span>”</span> a real entity <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sui generis</span></span>, really distinct from the
absolute entities of subject, term and foundation, and in contradistinction
to these and all absolute entities a <span class="tei tei-q">“relative entity,”</span>
actually existing in the real universe independently of our
thought? Or is it, on the contrary, itself formally a mere product
of our thought, a product of the mental act of comparison, an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens
rationis</span></span> an aspect superadded by our minds to the extremes compared,
and to the foundation in virtue of which we compare
them?

A good many scholastics, and some of them men of great name,<a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href="#note_419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a>

of the predicamental relation cannot be vindicated—against idealists,
who would reduce all relations to mere logical entities—otherwise

independent of our thought: adding as an argument that if relation
formally as such is anything at all, if all relation be not a
mere mental fabrication, it is essentially a <span class="tei tei-q">“relative”</span> entity, and
that manifestly a <span class="tei tei-q">“relative”</span> entity cannot be really identical with
any <span class="tei tei-q">“absolute”</span> entity. And they claim for this view the authority
of St Thomas.<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a>

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">esse ad</span></em>,”</span> is a product of our mental comparison of subject with
term. It is not itself a real entity or a real mode, superadded
to the reality of extremes and foundation.

In the first place there is no need to suppose the reality of such a
relative entity. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Entia non sunt multiplicanda præter necessitatem.</span></span>
It is an abuse of realism to suppose that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> element of a relation,
its <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse ad</span></span>,”</span> is a distinct and separate reality. The reality of
the praedicamental relation is safeguarded without any such postulate.

accident which is real independently of our thought, the predicamental
relation is not a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mere ens rationis</span></span>. It has a foundation
in reality. It is an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis cum fundamento in re</span></span>. This is
a sufficient counter-assertion to Idealism, and a sufficient reason
for treating relation as a distinct category of real being.

That there is no need for such a relative entity will be manifest
if we consider the simple case of two bars of iron each a
yard long. The length of each is an absolute accident of each.
The length of either, considered absolutely and in itself, is not
formally the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">equality</span></em> of this with the other. Nor are both lengths
considered separately the formal relation of equality. But both
considered together are the adequate foundation of this formal
relation; both considered together are this relation <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potentially</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fundamentally</span></em>, so that all that is needed for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em>
relation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">equality</span></em> is the mental apprehension of the two lengths
together. The mental process of comparison is the only thing
required to make the potential relation actual; and the product
of this mental process is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formality</span></em> or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse ad</span></span>”</span> of the relation,
the actual reference of the extremes to each other. Besides the
absolute accidents which constitute the foundation of the relation
something more is required for the constitution of the
adequate predicamental relation. This <span class="tei tei-q">“something more,”</span> however,
is a mind capable of comparing the extremes, and not any
real entity distinct from extremes and foundation. Antecedently
to the act of comparison the formally relative element of the
relation, its <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse ad</span></span>,”</span> was not anything actual; it was the mere
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">comparability</span></em> of the extremes in virtue of the foundation. If the
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse ad</span></span>”</span> were a separate real entity, a relative entity, really

distinct from extremes and foundation, what sort of entity could
it be? Being an accident, it should inhere in, or be a mode of
its subject. But if it did it would lose its formally relative
character by becoming an inherent mode of an absolute
reality. While to conceive it as an entity astride on both extremes,
and bridging or connecting these together, would be to
substitute the crude imagery of the imagination for intellectual
thought.

In the second place, if a subject can acquire a relation, or

than the other or absolute categories of real being: not as if it were a sort of

it can perish not merely by the destruction of its subject like other accidents,
but also by the destruction of its term while subject and foundation remain
unchanged.

that the predicamental relation is thus confounded with the

relation is always essential to its subject, whatever
this subject may be, while the predicamental relation, considered
formally, is a logical accident separable from its subject, and
considered fundamentally it is some absolute accident really distinct
from the substance of the related extremes. For instance,
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em> which mediates between cause and effect is itself
transcendentally related to both; while it is at the same time
the adequate foundation whereby cause and effect are predicamentally
related to each other.<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href="#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a>

If what we have called the formal element of a relation be
nothing really distinct from the extremes and foundation, it

equivalently denies all reality to relations, and is therefore in
substance identical with the idealist doctrine already rejected
(<a href="#Section_90" class="tei tei-ref">90</a>). But this is a misconception. According to idealists,
relations grounded on quality, quantity, causality, etc., are exclusively
in the intellect, in our mental activity and its mental products,
in our concepts alone, and are in no true sense characteristic of
reality. This is very different from saying that our concepts of
such relations are grounded in the realities compared, and that these
realities are really endowed with everything that constitutes such
relations, the comparative act of the intellect being required merely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to apprehend these characteristics and so to give the relation its
formal completeness.<a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432" href="#note_432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a> There is all the difference that exists between
a theory which so exaggerates the constitutive function of
thought as to reduce all intellectual knowledge to a knowledge of
mere subjective mental appearances, and a theory which, while recognizing
this function and its products, will not allow that these
cast any cloud or veil between the intellect and a genuine insight
into objective reality. These mental processes are guided by
reality; the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span> which are their products are grounded
in reality; moreover we can quite well distinguish between these
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mental</span></em> modes and products of our intellectual activity and the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> contents revealed to the mind in these modes and processes.
So long, therefore, as we avoid the mistake of ascribing to the
objective reality itself any of these mental modes (as, for instance,
extreme realists do when they assert the extramental reality of
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> universal), our recognition of them can in no way jeopardize
the objective validity of intellectual knowledge. Perhaps
an excessive timidity in this direction is in some degree accountable
for the <span class="tei tei-q">“abuse of realism”</span> which ascribes to the formal
element of a relation a distinct extramental,<a id="noteref_433" name="noteref_433" href="#note_433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a> objective reality.

being which we have been so far examining—substance, quality,

But it was pointed out in an early chapter (ch. <a href="#Chapter_II" class="tei tei-ref">ii.</a>) that the
universe of our experience is subject to change, that it is ever
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">becoming</span></em>, that it is the scene of a continuous world-process
which is apparently regulated by more or less stable principles
or laws, these laws and processes constituting the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universal order</span></em>
which it is the duty of the philosopher to study and explain.
We must now return to this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kinetic</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dynamic</span></em> aspect of
reality, and investigate the principles of change in things by a
study of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Causes</span></em>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As with the names of the other ultimate categories, so too
here, the general sense of the term <span class="tei tei-q">“cause”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa</span></span>, αἴτιον) is
familiar to all, while analysis reveals a great variety of modalities
of this common signification. We understand by a cause <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anything
which has a positive influence of any sort on the being or
happening of something else</span></em>. In philosophy this is the meaning
which has been attached traditionally to the term since the days
of Aristotle; though in its present-day scientific use the term has
almost lost this meaning, mainly through the influence of modern
phenomenism.<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href="#note_434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a> The traditional notion of cause is usually
expounded by comparing it with certain kindred notions:

objects of thought is sufficient to constitute the one a <span class="tei tei-q">“principle”</span>
of the other; but a mere extrinsic or time sequence is not
sufficient. A <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical</span></em> principle is some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em> from which further
truths are or may be derived. A <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> principle is some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reality</span></em>
from which the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">happening</span></em> of something originates and
proceeds.<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a> If this procession involves a real and positive
influence of the principle on that which proceeds from it, such a
real principle is a cause. But there may be a real and intrinsic
connexion without any such influence. For instance, in the
substantial changes which occur in physical nature the generation
of the new substantial formative principle necessarily presupposes
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">privation</span></em> of the one which antecedently <span class="tei tei-q">“informed”</span> the
material principle; but this <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">privatio formae</span></span>”</span> has no positive
influence on the generation of the new <span class="tei tei-q">“form”</span>; it is, however, the
necessary and natural antecedent to the generation of the latter;
hence although this <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">privatio formae</span></span>”</span> is a real principle of
substantial change (the process or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fieri</span></span>) it is not a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em> of the

A <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">condition</span></em>, in the proper sense of a necessary condition or
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">conditio sine qua non</span></span>, is something which must be realized or
fulfilled before the event or effect in question can happen or be
produced. On the side of the latter there is real dependence,
but from the side of the former there is no real and positive influence
on the happening of the event. The influence of the
condition is negative; or, if positive, it is only indirect, consisting
in the removal of some obstacle—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">removens probibens</span></span>”</span>—to the
positive influence of the cause. In this precisely a condition
differs from a cause: windows, for instance, are a condition for
the lighting of a room in the daylight, but the sun is the cause.
The distinction is clear and intelligible, nor may it be ignored in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a philosophical analysis of causality. At the same time it is easy
to understand that where, as in the inductive sciences, there is
question of discovering <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the antecedents, positive and negative,
of any given kind of phenomenon, in order to bring to light and

sale is an occasion for buying cheaply; night is an occasion of
theft; bad companionship is an occasion of sin. An occasion
has no intrinsic connexion with the effect as in the case of a
principle, nor is it necessary for the production of the effect as
in the case of a condition. It is spoken of only in connexion
with the action of a free cause; and it differs from a cause in
having no positive and direct influence on the production of the
effect. It has, however, a real though indirect influence on the
production of the effect by soliciting and aiding the determination
of the free efficient cause to act. In so far as it does exert
such an influence it may be regarded as a partial efficient cause,
not a physical but a moral cause, of the effect.

95. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Classification of Causes: Aristotle's Fourfold
Division.</span></span>—In modern times many scientists and philosophers
have thought it possible to explain the order and course of nature,
the whole cosmic process and the entire universe of our experience,
by an appeal to the operation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient causes</span></em>. Espousing a mechanical,
as opposed to a teleological, conception of the universe,
they have denied or ignored all influence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purpose</span></em>, and eschewed
all study of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final causes</span></em>. Furthermore, misconceiving or neglecting
the category of substance, and the doctrine of substantial change,
they find no place in their speculations for any consideration of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> causes. Yet without final, formal and material
causes, so fully analysed by Aristotle<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441" href="#note_441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a> and the scholastics, no satisfactory
explanation of the world of our experience can possibly be
found. Let us therefore commence by outlining the traditional
fourfold division of causes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have seen already that change involves composition or
compositeness in the thing that is subject to change. Hence
two <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em> principles contribute to the constitution of such a
thing, the one a passive, determinable principle, its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material cause</span></em>,
the other an active, determining principle, its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal cause</span></em>.
Some changes in material things are superficial, not reaching to
the substance itself of the thing; these are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em>, involving
the union of some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“form”</span> with the concrete pre-existing
substance as material (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">secunda</span></span>”</span>). Others are more
profound, changes of the substance itself; these are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em>,
involving the union of a new <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substantial</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“form”</span> with the primal
material principal (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">prima</span></span>”</span>) of the substance undergoing
the change. But whether the change be substantial or accidental
we can always distinguish in the resulting composite thing two
intrinsic constitutive principles, its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal cause</span></em> and its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material
cause</span></em>. The agencies in nature which, by their activity, bring
about change, are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient causes</span></em>. Finally, since it is an undeniable
fact that there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">order</span></em> in the universe, that its processes
give evidence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regularity</span></em>, of operation according to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law</span></em>,
that the cosmos reveals a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">harmonious co-ordination of manifold</span></em>
agencies and a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subordination of means to ends</span></em>, it follows that
there must be working in and through all nature a directive
principle, a principle of plan or design, a principle according to
which those manifold agencies work together in fulfilment of a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
purpose, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the attainment of ends</span></em>. Hence the reality of a fourth
class of causes, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final causes</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The separate influence of each of those four kinds of cause
can be clearly illustrated by reference to the production of any
work of art. When, for instance, a sculptor chisels a statue from
a block of marble, the latter is the material cause (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia secunda</span></span>)
of the statue, the form which he induces on it by his labour is the
formal cause (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma accidentalis</span></span>), the sculptor himself as agent is
the efficient cause, and the motive from which he works—money
fame, esthetic pleasure, etc.—is the final cause.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The formal and material causes are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em> to the effect;
they constitute the effect <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in facto esse</span></span>, the distinction of each from
the latter being an inadequate real distinction. It is not so usual
nowadays to call these intrinsic constitutive principles of things
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causes</span></em> of the latter; but they verify the general definition of
cause. The other two causes, the efficient and the final, are
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em> to the effect, and really and adequately distinct from it,<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a>
extrinsic principles of its production, its <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fieri</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This classification of causes is adequate;<a id="noteref_443" name="noteref_443" href="#note_443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">443</span></span></a> it answers all the
questions that can be asked in explanation of the production of
any effect: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a quo?</span></span> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex quo?</span></span> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per quid?</span></span> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">propter quid?</span></span> Nor is
there any sort of cause which cannot be brought under some
one or other of those four heads. What is called an <span class="tei tei-q">“exemplar
cause,”</span> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa exemplaris</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the ideal or model or plan in the
mind of an intelligent agent, according to which he aims and
strives to execute his work, may be regarded as an extrinsic
formal cause; or again, in so far as it aids and equips the agent
for his task, an efficient cause; or, again, in so far as it represents
a good to be realized, a final cause.<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The objects of our knowledge are in a true sense causes of
our knowledge: any such object may be regarded as an efficient
cause, both physical and moral, of this knowledge, in so far as by
its action on our minds it determines the activity of our cognitive
faculties; or, again, as a final cause, inasmuch as it is the end and
aim of the knowledge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The essence of the soul is, as we have seen (<a href="#Section_69" class="tei tei-ref">69</a>), not exactly
an efficient cause of the faculties which are its properties; but it
is their final cause, inasmuch as their <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'être</span></span> is to perfect it;
and their subjective or material cause, inasmuch as it is the seat
and support of these faculties.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fourfold division is analogical, not univocal: though the
matter, the form, the agent, and the end or purpose, all contribute
positively to the production of the effect, it is clear that
the character of the causal influence is widely different in each
case.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, its members do not demand distinct subjects: all four
classes of cause may be verified in the same subject. For instance,
the human soul is a formal cause in regard to the composite
human individual, a material cause in regard to its habits,
an efficient cause in regard to its acts, and a final cause in regard
to its faculties.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Furthermore, the fourfold division is not an immediate
division, for it follows the division of cause in general into
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em> causes. Finally, it is a division of the
causes which we find to be operative <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em> the universe. But the
philosophical study of the universe will lead us gradually to the
conviction that itself and all the causes in it are themselves <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contingent</span></em>,
themselves caused by and dependent on, a Cause <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">outside</span></em>
or extrinsic to the universe, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Uncaused</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Uncreated</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Self-Existent</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Necessary Cause</span></em> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Causa Prima</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Increata</span></span>), at once the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> cause of all things. In contrast with this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Uncreated</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First Cause</span></em>, all the other causes we have now to investigate
are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">created</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> causes (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causae secundae</span></span>,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">creatae</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A cause may be either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">total</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adequate</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">partial</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inadequate</span></em>,
according as the effect is due to its influence solely, or
to its influence in conjunction with, or dependence on, the
influence of some other cause or causes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of the same order</span></em>. A
created cause, therefore, is a total cause if the effect is due to
its influence independently of other created causes; though of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
course all created causes are dependent, both as to their existence
and as to their causality, on the influence of the First Cause.
Without the activity of created efficient and final causes the First
Cause can accomplish directly whatever these can accomplish—except
their very causality itself, which cannot be actualized
without them, but for which He can supply <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">eminenter</span></span>. Similarly,
while it is incompatible with His Infinite Perfection that He discharge
the function of material or formal cause of finite composite
things, He can immediately create these latter by the
simultaneous production (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex nihilo</span></span>) and union of their material
and formal principles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A cause is said to be <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu secundo</span></span> when it is actually exercising
its causal influence. Antecedently to such exercise, at
least <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">prioritate naturae</span></span>, it is said to be <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu primo</span></span>: when it
has the expedite power to discharge its function as cause it is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in
actu primo proximo</span></span>, while if its power is in any way incomplete,
hampered or unready, it is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu primo remoto</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many other divisions of cause, subordinate to the Aristotelian
division, will be explained in connexion with the members of
this latter.

96. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Material and Formal Causes.</span></span>—These are properly
subject-matter for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cosmology</span></em>. We will therefore very briefly
supplement what has been said already concerning them in connexion
with the doctrine of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Change</span></em> (ch. <a href="#Chapter_II" class="tei tei-ref">ii.</a>). By a material cause
we mean <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that out of which anything is made</span></em>: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">id ex quo aliquid fit</span></span>.
Matter is correlative with form: from the union of these there
results a composite reality endowed with either essential or
accidental unity—with the former if the material principle be absolutely
indeterminate and the correlative form substantial,
with the latter if the material principle be some actually existing individual
reality and the form some supervening accident. Properly
speaking only corporeal substances have material causes,<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href="#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a> but the
term <span class="tei tei-q">“material cause”</span> is used in an extended sense to signify any
potential, passive, receptive subject of formative or actuating
principles: thus the soul is the subjective or material cause of
its faculties and habits; essence of existence; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genus of differentia</span></em>,
etc.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In what does the positive causal influence of a material cause
consist? How does it contribute positively to the actualization
of the composite reality of which it is the material cause? It
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">receives</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unites with</span></em> the form which is educed from its potentiality
by the action of efficient causes, and thus contributes to
the generation of the concrete, composite individual reality.<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href="#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is by reason of the causality of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal cause</span></em> that we
speak of a thing being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em> such or such. As correlative
of material cause it finds its proper application in reference to
the constitution of corporeal things. The formative principle,
called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span>, which actuates, determines, specifies the
material principle, and by union with the latter constitutes an
individual corporeal substance of a definite kind, is the (substantial)
formal cause of this composite substance.<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a> The material principle
of corporeal things is of itself indifferent to any species of body;
it is the form that removes this indefiniteness and determines the
matter, by its union with the latter, to constitute a definite type
of corporeal substance.<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href="#note_448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">448</span></span></a> The existence of different species of
living organisms and different types of inorganic matter in
the universe implies in the constitution of these things a common
material principle, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia prima</span></span>, and a multiplicity of
differentiating, specifying, formative principles, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formae substantiales</span></span>.
That the distinction between these two principles in the
constitution of any individual corporeal substance, whether living
or inorganic, is not merely a virtual distinction between metaphysical
(generic and specific) grades of being in the individual,
but a real distinction between separable entities, is a scholastic
thesis established in the Special Metaphysics of the organic and
inorganic domains of the universe.<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href="#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> is a perfecting, actuating principle, the term is
often used synonymously with <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actuality</span></em>. And since besides
the essential perfection which a being has by virtue of its substantial
form it may have accidental perfections by reason of
supervening accidental forms, these, too, are formal causes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In what does the causal influence of the formal cause consist?
In communicating itself intrinsically to the material principle or
passive subject from whose potentiality it is evoked by the action
of efficient causes; in actuating that potentiality by intrinsic
union therewith, and thus determining the individual subject to
be actually or formally an individual of such or such a kind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The material and formal causes are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em> principles of the
constitution of things. We next pass to an analysis of the two
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em> causes, and firstly of the efficient cause and its causality.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
97. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Efficient Cause; Traditional Concept Explained.</span></span>—By
efficient cause we understand that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by which</span></em> anything takes
place, happens, occurs: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">id a quo aliquid fit</span></span>. The world of our
external and internal experience is the scene of incessant <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">changes</span></em>:
men and things not only are, but are constantly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">becoming</span></em>. Now
every such change is originated by some active principle, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this we call the efficient cause of the change. Aristotle called it
τὸ κινητικόν or ἡ ἀρχὴ κινητική, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kinetic</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moving</span></em> principle;
or again, ἀρχὴ κινησέως ἢ μεταβολῆς ἐν ἑτέρω, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium motus
vel mutationis in alio</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the principle of motion or change in
some other thing”</span>. The result achieved by this change, the
actualized potentiality, is called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effect</span></em>; the causality itself of
the efficient cause is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em> (ποίησις), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motion</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em>—and,
from the point of view of the effect, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passio</span></span> (παθήσις).
The perfection or endowment whereby an efficient cause acts,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> its efficiency (ἐνέργεια), is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active power</span></em> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia seu virtus
activa</span></span>); it is also called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">force</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potential energy</span></em> in reference
to inanimate agents, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faculty</span></em> in reference to animate agents,
especially men and animals. This active power of an efficient
cause or agent is to be carefully distinguished from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive
potentiality</span></em> acted upon and undergoing change. The former
connotes a perfection, the latter an imperfection: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unumquodque
agit inquantum est in actu, patitur vero inquantum, est in potentia</span></em>.
The scope of the active power of a cause is the measure of its
actuality, of its perfection in the scale of reality; while the extent
of the passive potentiality of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">patiens</span></span> is a measure of its
relative imperfection. The actuation of the former is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio</span></span>, that
of the latter <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passio</span></span>. The point of ontological connexion of the
two <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentiae</span></span> is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motus</span></span>, κίνησις), this being at once
the formal perfecting of the passive potentiality in the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">patiens</span></span> or
effect, and the immediate term of the efficiency or active power of
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">agens</span></span> or cause. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Actio</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passio</span></span>, therefore, are not expressions

98. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Some Scholia on Causation. the Principle Of
Causality.</span></span>—Before enumerating the principal kinds of efficient
cause, and analysing the nature of efficient causality, we may set
down here certain self-evident axioms and aphorisms concerning
causation in general. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The most important of these is the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Principle of Causality</span></span>, which has been enunciated in a variety
of ways: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Whatever happens has a cause</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Whatever begins to be
has a cause</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Whatever is contingent has a cause</span></em>; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Nothing occurs
without a cause</span></em>. Not everything that begins to be has necessarily
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> cause, or a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> cause, really distinct from itself.
For instance, simple spiritual beings, like the human soul, have
no material cause, nor any formal cause or constitutive principle
distinct from their essence. Similarly, the whole universe, having
been created <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex nihilo</span></span>, had no pre-existing material cause. All
the material beings, however, which are produced, generated,
brought into actual existence in the course of the incessant changes
which characterize the physical universe, have both material and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
formal causes. But the Principle of Causality refers mainly to
extrinsic causes. It is commonly understood only of efficient
causes; and only in regard to these is it self-evident. We shall
see that as a matter of fact nothing happens without a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> cause:
that intelligent purpose pervades reality through and through.
This, however, is a conclusion, not a principle. What is really
a self-evident, axiomatic, necessary principle is that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whatever happens
has an</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">efficient</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>. Only the Necessary, Self-Existing,
Eternal Being, has the sufficient reason of His actual existence in
Himself, in His own essence. That any being which is contingent
could exist <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">independently of some other actual being</span></em> as the cause of
this existence; that it could have come into existence or begun
to exist <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from absolute nothingness, or be produced or brought into
actual existence without any actual being to produce it</span></em>; or that, once
existing and subject to change, it could undergo change and have
its potentialities actualized <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without any actual being to cause such
change</span></em> (<a href="#Section_10" class="tei tei-ref">10</a>)—all this is positively unthinkable and absolutely repugnant
to our intelligence; all this our reason peremptorily declares
to be intrinsically impossible. Nor is there question of a mere
psychological inconceivability, such as might be due to a long-continued
custom of associating the idea of a <span class="tei tei-q">“beginning”</span> with
the idea of a <span class="tei tei-q">“cause”</span> of this beginning—as phenomenists generally
contend.<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href="#note_453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a> There is question of an impossibility which
our reason categorically dictates to be a real, ontological impossibility.
The Principle of Causality is therefore a necessary, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>,
self-evident principle.

99. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Classification of Efficient Causes.</span></span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) We have
already referred to the distinction between the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></em> Cause and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Second</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Created</span></em> Causes. The former is absolutely independent
of all other beings both as to His power and as to the exercise
of this power. The latter are dependent, for both, upon the
former.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The distinction between a first, or primary, or independent
cause, and second, or subordinate, or dependent causes can be
understood not only of causes universally, but also as obtaining
among created causes themselves. In general the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subordination</span></em>
of a cause to a superior or anterior cause may be either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental</span></em>: essential, when the second cause depends—either
for its existence or for an indispensable complement of its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
efficiency—on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">present</span></em> actual influence of the other cause;
accidental when the second cause has indeed received its
existence or efficiency from this other cause, but is now no longer
dependent, for its existence or action, on the latter. Thus,
living organisms are, as causes, accidentally subordinate to their
parent organisms: they derived their existence from the latter,
but are independent of these when in their maturity they continue
to exist, and live, and act of themselves and for themselves.
But all creatures, on the other hand, are, as causes, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essentially</span></em>
subordinate to the Creator, inasmuch as they can exist and act
only in constant dependence on the ever present and ever actual
conserving and concurring influence of the Creator.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is obvious that all the members of any series of causes
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essentially</span></em> subordinate the one to the other <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must exist simultaneously</span></em>.
Whether such a series could be infinite depends, therefore,
on the question whether an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually infinite multitude</span></em> is
intrinsically possible. This difficulty cannot be urged with such
force against an infinite regress in causes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidentally</span></em> subordinate
to one another; for here such a regress would not involve an
actually infinite multitude of things existing simultaneously.
In the case of essentially subordinate causes, moreover, the
series, whatever about its infinity, must contain, or rather imply
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></em> it, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> cause which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> in the sense of being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">independent</span></em>,
or exempt from the subordination characteristic of all the others.
And the reason is obvious: Since no one of them can exist or
act except dependently on another, and this on another, and so
on, it is manifest that the series cannot exist at all unless there
is some one cause which, unlike all the others, exists and acts
without such subordination or dependence. Hence, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in essentially
subordinate causes an infinite regress is impossible</span></em>.<a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href="#note_456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a> In Natural

principal cause, not to the instrumental. The notion of an
instrument is quite a familiar notion. An instrument helps the
principal agent to do what the latter could not otherwise do, or
at least not so easily. An instrument therefore is really a cause.
It contributes positively to the production of the effect. How
does it do so? By reason of its nature or structure it influences,
modifies, and directs in a particular way, the efficiency of the
principal cause. But this property of the instrumental cause
comes into play only when the latter is being actually used by a
principal cause. A pen, a saw, a hammer, a spade, have each
its own instrumentality. The pen will not cut, nor the saw
mould iron, nor the hammer dig, nor the spade write, for the
agent that uses them. Each will produce its own kind of effect
when used; but none of them will produce any effect except when
used: though each has in itself permanently and inherently the
power to produce its own proper effect in use.<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href="#note_457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a> We have instanced

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">semen</span></em> whereby living organisms propagate their kind is an

The notion of an instrumental cause involves then (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) subordination
of the latter, in its instrumental activity, to a principal

modifying and directing the influence of the principal cause.
This property whereby the instrumental cause modifies or

the distinction between the principal and the instrumental cause
being that whereas the former acts by virtue of a power permanently
inherent in it as a natural perfection, the latter acts as an instrument

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may, therefore, define an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">instrumental</span></em> cause as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one which,

in relation to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First Cause</span></em>. For, not only are they
dependent on the latter for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conservation</span></em> of their nature and

activity: it would violate the <span class="tei tei-q">“law of universal causation”</span>.
We reply that free activity is by no means causeless activity.
The free agent himself is in the fullest and truest sense the efficient
cause of his free acts. It is by his causal, efficient influence
that the act of free choice is determined and elicited. Free
causality evidently does not violate the necessary, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> principle
set forth above under the title of the Principle of Causality.
But—they urge in the second place—it violates the <span class="tei tei-q">“law of universal
causation,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the law that every event in nature must be
the result of some set of phenomenal antecedents which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitate</span></em>
it, and which, therefore, whenever verified, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> produce this
result and no other; and by violating this law it removes all
supposed <span class="tei tei-q">“free”</span> activities from the domain of that regularity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and uniformity without which no scientific knowledge of such
phenomena would be possible. To this we reply, firstly, that
the law of uniform causation in nature, the law which is known
as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Law of the Uniformity of Nature,”</span> and which, under the
title of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Law of Universal Causation”</span> is confounded by determinists
and phenomenists with the entirely distinct <span class="tei tei-q">“Principle
of Causality”</span>—is not by any means a law of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em> causation.<a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href="#note_462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a>
The statement that Nature is uniform in its activities is not the
expression of an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, necessary truth, like the Principle of
Causality. It is a generalization from experience. And experience
testifies to the existence of grades in this all-prevailing
uniformity. In the domain of physical nature it is the expression
of the Free Will of the Author of Nature, who may miraculously
derogate from this physical uniformity for higher, moral ends. In
the domain of deliberate human activities it is the expression of that
less rigorous but no less real uniformity which is dependent on
the free will of man. And just as the possibility of miracles in
the former domain does not destroy the regularity on which the
generalizations of the physical sciences are based, so neither does
the fact of human free will render worthless or unreliable the
generalizations of the human sciences (ethical, social, political,
economic, etc.) about human conduct. Were the appearance of
miracles in the physical domain, or the ordinary play of free will
in the human domain, entirely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">capricious</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motiveless</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purposeless</span></em>,
the results would, of course, be chaotic, precarious, unaccountable,
unintelligible, and scientific knowledge of them would be
impossible: for the assumption that reality is the work of intelligent
purpose, and is therefore a regular, orderly expression of
law, in other words, the assumption that the universe is intelligible,
is a prerequisite condition for scientific knowledge about
the universe. But determinists seem to assume that Divine
Providence and human free will must necessarily imply that the
whole universe of physical phenomena and human activities
would be an unintelligible chaos; and having erected this philosophical
scarecrow on a gratuitous assumption they think it will
gradually exorcise all belief in Divine Providence and human
freedom from the <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific”</span> mind!

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) Efficient causes are either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em>. A physical
efficient cause is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one which produces its effect by its own proper power

For instance, the billiard player is the physical cause of the
motion he imparts to the balls by means of the cue. A moral
cause is one which produces its effect by the representation of
something as good or evil to the mind of a free agent; by inducing
the latter through example, advice, persuasion, promises, threats,
commands, entreaties, etc., to produce the effect in question. For
instance, a master is the moral cause of what his servant does in
obedience to his commands. The motives set forth by way
of inducement to the latter are of course <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> causes of the latter's
action. But the former, by setting them forth, is the moral cause
of the action: he is undoubtedly more than a mere condition;
he contributes positively and efficiently to the effect. His
physical causation, however, does not reach to the effect itself,
but only to the effect wrought in the mind of the servant by his
command. It is causally connected with the physical action of
the servant by means of an intermediate link which we may call
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mental</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">psychical causation</span></em>—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">intentionalis</span></span>,”</span>—the action of
cognition on the mind of a cognitive agent.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The agent employed by a moral cause to produce an effect
physically may be called an instrumental cause in a wide and less
proper sense of this term, the instrumentality being moral, not
physical. Only free agents can be moral causes; and as a rule
they are termed moral causes only when they produce the effect
through the physical operation of another free agent. What if
they employ not free agents, nor yet inanimate instruments, but
agents endowed with sense cognition and sense appetite, to
produce effects? If a man set his dog at another, is he the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em> or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> cause of the injuries inflicted by the dog?
That he is the principal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> cause is unquestionable. But is
he the principal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> cause and the dog the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">instrument</span></em>? We
think it is more proper to call the principal efficient cause a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em>
cause in all cases where there intervenes between his physical
action and the effect an intermediate link of <span class="tei tei-q">“psychical”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“intentional”</span> action, even though, as in the present example,
this psychical link is of the sentient, not the intellectual, order.

causes of an event. Thus, the application of the fuse to the charge
of dynamite in a rock is the immediate or determining cause of the
explosion which bursts the rock; the lighting of the fuse, the
placing of the charge, etc., the more proximate causes; the making
of the fuse, dynamite, instruments, etc., the more remote causes.

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active power</span></em> as causes; and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em>, or exercise of
this power as cause. The former, the individual, concrete agent,
is the <span class="tei tei-q">“principium <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quod</span></em> agit,”</span> and is called the <span class="tei tei-q">“causa <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ut quae</span></em>”</span>.
The nature and the active power of the agent are each a <span class="tei tei-q">“principium
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quo</span></em> agens agit,”</span> the remote and the proximate principle
of action respectively; and each is called a <span class="tei tei-q">“causa <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ut qua</span></em>”</span>. The
action of the agent is the cause of the effect in the sense that the
actual production or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fieri</span></span> of anything is the immediate cause of
this thing <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in facto esse</span></span>. Corresponding to these distinctions we

importance. By ignoring them, and by losing sight of the
intrinsic (formal and material) causes of natural phenomena,
many modern scientists and philosophers have confounded cause
and effect with the process itself of causation, and declared that
cause and effect are not distinct realities, but only two mental
aspects of one and the same reality.<a id="noteref_465" name="noteref_465" href="#note_465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">465</span></span></a>

The same may be said of all the distinctions so far enumerated. They
are absolutely essential to the formation of clear ideas on the question of

100. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Objective Validity of the Traditional Concept
of Efficient Causality.</span></span>—We have seen how modern
sensists, phenomenists, and positivists have doubted or denied
the power of the human mind to attain to a knowledge of any
objective reality corresponding to the category of substance
(§§ <a href="#Section_61" class="tei tei-ref">61</a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>). They treat in a similar way the traditional concept
of efficient causality. And in delivering their open or veiled
attacks on the real validity of this notion they have made a misleading
use of the proper and legitimate function of the inductive
sciences. The chief aim of the natural scientist is to seek out
and bring to light the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole group of necessitating and indispensable</span></em>
(phenomenal) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">antecedents</span></em> of any given kind of event, and to
formulate the natural law of their connexion with this kind of
event. There is no particular objection to his calling these antecedents
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariable</span></em>, or even the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitating</span></em>,
antecedents of the event; provided he does not claim what he
cannot prove—and what, as we shall see later (<a href="#Section_104" class="tei tei-ref">104</a>), is not true,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>—that the invariability or necessity of this connexion between
phenomenal antecedents and consequents is wholly inviolable,
fatal, absolute in character. He may rightly claim for any such
established connexion the hypothetical, conditional necessity
which characterizes all inductively established laws of physical
nature. There are such antecedents and consequents in the
universe; there are connexions between them which are more
than mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">casual</span></em> connexions of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time sequence</span></em>, which are connexions
of physical law, inasmuch as they are connexions based
on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natures</span></em> of agencies in an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">orderly</span></em> universe, connexions of
these agencies with their natural effects. All this is undeniable.
Moreover, so long as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the scientist</span></em> confines himself to inferences
concerning such connexions between phenomena, to inferences
and generalizations based on the assumed uniformity of nature,
he is working in his proper sphere. Nay, even if he chooses to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
designate these groups of invariable phenomenal antecedents by
the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“physical causes”</span> we know what he means; though
we perceive some danger of confusion, inasmuch as we see him
arrogating to the notion of regularity or uniformity of connexion
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> to the notion of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical law</span></em>, a term, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causality</span></em>, which traditionally
expressed something quite distinct from this, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the
notion of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positive influence</span></em> of one thing on the being or happening
of another. But when <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phenomenist philosophers</span></em> adopt this
usage we cannot feel reassured against the danger of confusion by
such protestations as those of Mill in the following passage:—<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a>

I premise, then, that when in the course of this inquiry I speak of the
cause of any phenomenon, I do not mean a cause which is not itself a phenomenon;
I make no research into the ultimate or ontological cause of anything.
To adopt a distinction familiar in the writings of the Scotch metaphysicians, and
especially of Reid, the causes with which I concern myself are not </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">efficient</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, but
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">physical</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> causes. They are causes in that sense alone, in which one physical fact
is said to be the cause of another. Of the efficient causes of phenomena, or
whether any such causes exist at all I am not called upon to give an opinion.
The notion of causation is deemed, by the schools of metaphysics most in
vogue at the present moment, to imply a mysterious and most powerful tie,
such as cannot, or at least does not, exist between any physical fact and that
other physical fact on which it is invariably consequent, and which is popularly
termed its cause; and thence is deduced the supposed necessity of ascending
higher, into the essences and inherent constitution of things, to find the true
cause, the cause which is not only followed by, but actually produces, the
effect. No such necessity exists for the purposes of the present inquiry, nor
will any such doctrine be found in the following pages. The only notion of
a cause, which the theory of induction requires, is such a notion as can be
gained by experience. The Law of Causation, which is the main pillar of inductive
science, is but the familiar truth, that invariability of succession is found
by observation to obtain between every fact in nature and some other fact
which has preceded it; independently of all considerations respecting the
ultimate mode of production of phenomena, and of every other question regarding
the nature of </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Things in themselves</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.

This passage—which expresses fairly well the phenomenist
and positivist attitude in regard to the reality, or at least the
cognoscibility, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> causes—fairly bristles with inaccuracies,
misconceptions, and false insinuations.<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href="#note_470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">470</span></span></a> But we are concerned here
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only with the denial that any notion of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> cause <span class="tei tei-q">“can be
gained from experience,”</span> and the doubt consequently cast on the
objective validity of this notion. The Sensism which regards our
highest intellectual activities as mere organic associations of
sentient states of consciousness, has for its logical issue the Positivism
which contends that all valid knowledge is confined to the
existence and time and space relations of sense phenomena. In
thus denying to the mind all power of attaining to a valid knowledge
of anything suprasensible—such as substance, power, force,
efficient cause, etc.—Positivism passes over into Agnosticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In refutation of this philosophy, in so far as it denies that we
have any grounds in experience for believing in the real existence
of efficient causes, we may set down in the first place this universal
belief itself of the human race that there are in the universe efficient
causes of the events that happen in it. Men universally
believe that they themselves as agents contribute by a real and
positive influence to the actual occurrence of their own thoughts,
reasonings, wishes, desires, sensations; that their mental resolves
to speak, walk, write, eat, or perform any other external, bodily
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
works do really, positively, and efficiently produce or cause those
works; that external phenomena have a real influence on happenings
in their own bodies, that fire burns them and food
nourishes them; that external phenomena also have a real and
positive influence on their sense organs, and through these on
their minds by the production there of conscious states such as
sensations; finally that external phenomena have a real and
positive influence on one another; that by action and interaction
they really produce the changes that are constantly taking place
in the universe: that the sun does really heat and light the earth,
that the sowing of the seed in springtime has really a positive influence
on the existence of crops in the harvest, that the taking of
poison has undoubtedly a real influence on the death which results
from it. And if any man of ordinary intelligence and plain
common sense is told that such belief is an illusion, that in all
such cases the connexion between the things, facts or events which
he designates as <span class="tei tei-q">“cause”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“effect,”</span> is a mere connexion of invariable
time sequence between antecedents and consequents,
that in no case is there evidence of any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positive, productive influence</span></em>
of the one fact upon the other, he will either smile incredulously
and decline to take his objector seriously, or he will simply ask
the latter to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prove</span></em> the universal belief to be an illusion. His conviction
of the real and objective validity of his notion of efficient
cause, as something which positively influences the happening
of things, is so profound and ineradicable that it must necessarily
be grounded in, and confirmed by, his constant experience of the
real world in which he lives and moves. Not that he professes
to be able to explain the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of this efficient influence in which
he believes. Even if he were a philosopher he might not be able
to satisfy himself or others on this point But being a plain man
of ordinary intelligence he has sense enough to distinguish between
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existence</span></em> of a fact and its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>, its explanation, its <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quomodo</span></span>;
and to believe in the real existence of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positive efficient, productive</span></em>
influence of cause on effect, however this influence is to be conceived
or explained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A second argument for the objective validity of the concept
of efficient cause may be drawn from a consideration of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Principle of Causality</span></em>. The experience on which the plain man
grounds his belief in the validity of his notion of cause is not mere
uninterpreted sense experience in its raw and brute condition, so
to speak; it is this sense experience rationalized, assimilated into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his intelligence—spontaneously and half unconsciously, perhaps—by
the light of the self-evident Principle of Causality, that whatever
happens has a cause. When the plain man believes that all
the various agencies in nature, like those enumerated above, are
not merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">temporal</span></em> antecedents or concomitants of their effects,
but are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really productive</span></em> of those effects, he is really applying the
universal and necessary truth—that an <span class="tei tei-q">“event,”</span> a <span class="tei tei-q">“happening,”</span> a
<span class="tei tei-q">“change,”</span> a <span class="tei tei-q">“commencement”</span> of any new actual mode of being
demands the existence of another actual being as cause—the truth
embodied in the Principle of Causality, to this, that, and the other
event of his experience: he is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">locating</span></em> the <span class="tei tei-q">“causes”</span> of these
events in the various persons and things which he regards as the
agents or producers of these events. In making such applications
he may very possibly err in detail. But no actual application of
the principle at all is really required for establishing the objective
validity of the concept of cause. There are philosophers who—erroneously,
as we shall see—deny that the Principle of Causality
finds its application in the domain of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">created</span></em> things, who hold,
in other words, that no created beings can be efficient causes
(102), and who nevertheless recognize, and quite rightly, that
the concept of efficient cause is an objectively valid concept. And
they do so because they see that since events, beginnings, happenings,
changes, are real, there must be really and objectively
existent an efficient cause of them—whatever and wherever
such efficient cause may be: whether it be one or manifold, finite
or infinite, etc.

We have already examined Hume's attempt to deny the ontological
necessity of the Principle of Causality and to substitute therefor a subjectively
or psychologically necessary </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">feeling of expectation</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> grounded on habitual
association of ideas. Kant, on the other hand, admits the self-evident,
necessary character of the Principle; but holds that, since this necessity is
engendered by the mind's imposing a subjective form of thought on the data
of sense consciousness, the principle is validly applicable only to connexions
within the world of mental appearances, and not at all to the world of real
being. He thus transfers the discussion to the domain of Epistemology,
where in opposition to his theory of knowledge the Principle of Causality can
be shown to be applicable to all contingent reality, and to be therefore
legitimately employed in Natural Theology for the purpose of establishing
the real existence of an Uncaused First Cause.

101. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Origin of the Concept of Efficient Cause.</span></span>—We
have seen that universal belief in the real existence of efficient
causes is grounded in experience. The formation of the concept,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and its application or extension to the world within and around
us, are gradual.<a id="noteref_471" name="noteref_471" href="#note_471"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">471</span></span></a> Active power, force, energy, efficiency, faculty,
or by whatever other name we may call it, is of course experienced
only in its actual exercise, in action, motion, production of
change. Our first experience of its exercise is found in our consciousness
of our own personal activities, mental and bodily: in
our thinking, willing or choosing, in our deliberate control of
our mental processes, and in the deliberate exercise of our
sense faculties and bodily organs. In all this we are conscious
of exerting power, force, energy: we apprehend <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ourselves</span></em> as
agents or efficient causes of our mental processes and bodily
movements. We apprehend these happenings as due to the
exercise of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our own power to produce them</span></em>. Seeing other human
beings behave like ourselves, we infer by analogy that they also
possess and exercise active powers like our own, that they, too,
are efficient causes. Finally, observing that effects like to those
produced by ourselves, whether in ourselves or in the material
world around us, are also consequent on certain other changes
in external nature, whether organic or inorganic, we infer by
analogy that these corporeal things have also powers, forces,
energies, whereby they produce these effects. While our senses
testify only to time and space connexions between physical
happenings in external nature, our intellect apprehends action
and interaction, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> causal dependence of events on the active
influence or efficiency of physical things as agents or causes.<a id="noteref_472" name="noteref_472" href="#note_472"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">472</span></span></a>
Thus, our knowledge of the existence and nature of the forces,
powers and energies which constitute <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> things efficient
causes is posterior to, and derived by analogy from, our knowledge
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mental</span></em> and bodily powers which reveal themselves
to us in our conscious vital processes as constituting our own
personal efficient causality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This conception of efficient causality even in the inanimate
things of external nature, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after the analogy of our own vital powers</span></em>
as revealed in our conscious activities, is sometimes disparaged
as naïve anthropomorphism. It just depends on the manner
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and degree in which we press the analogy. Observing that our
earlier notion of cause is <span class="tei tei-q">“the notion of power combined with a
purpose and an end”</span> (thus including <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> causality),
Newman remarks<a id="noteref_473" name="noteref_473" href="#note_473"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">473</span></span></a> that <span class="tei tei-q">“Accordingly, wherever the world is
young, the movements and changes of physical nature have been
and are spontaneously ascribed by its people to the presence and
will of hidden agents, who haunt every part of it, the woods, the
mountains and the streams, the air and the stars, for good or for
evil—just as children again, by beating the ground after falling,
imply that what has bruised them has intelligence”</span>. This is
anthropomorphism. So, too, would be the conception of the
forces or powers of inanimate nature as powers of sub-conscious
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em>”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appetition</span></em>”</span> (Leibniz), or, again, as rudimentary
or diminished <span class="tei tei-q">“will-power”</span> (Cousin).<a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href="#note_474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">474</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Physical phenomena,
as such, are without sense,”</span> as Newman rightly observes; and
consequently we may not attribute to them any sort of conscious
efficiency, whether perceptive or appetitive. But Newman
appears to err in the opposite direction when he adds that <span class="tei tei-q">“experience
teaches us nothing about physical phenomena as
causes”</span>.<a id="noteref_475" name="noteref_475" href="#note_475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">475</span></span></a> The truth lies between these extremes. Taking
experience in the wide sense in which it includes rational interpretation
of, and inference from, the data of internal and external
sense perception, experience certainly reveals to us the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existence</span></em>
of physical phenomena as efficient causes, or in other words that
there is real and efficient causality not only in our own persons
but also in the external physical universe; and as to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>
of this causality it also gives us at least some little reliable information.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By pursuing this latter question a little we shall be led to
examine certain difficulties which lie at the root of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Occasionalism</span></em>:
the error of denying that creatures, or at least merely corporeal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
creatures, can be in any true sense efficient causes. A detailed
inquiry into the nature of the active powers, forces or energies of
the inorganic universe, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> into the nature of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corporeal</span></em> efficient
causality, belongs to Cosmology; just as a similar inquiry into

Here we have only to ascertain what is common and
essential to all efficient causality as such, what in general is involved
in the exercise of efficient causality, in <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passio</span></span>,

way of co-operation or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em> with the created efficient cause—of
an Actual Being in whom the actuality of all effects is
contained in an eminently perfect way. Even with the Divine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em> a created cause cannot itself <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">create</span></em>, because even with
this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em> its efficiency attains only to the modifying or
changing of pre-existing being: and in creation there is no pre-existing
being, no material cause, no real passive potentiality to
be actuated. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without</span></em> this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em> not only can it not
create; it cannot even, as an efficient cause, actuate a real pre-existing
potentiality. And why? Because its efficiency cannot
attain to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">production of new actuality</span></em>. It determines the
mode of this actuality, and therein precisely lies the efficiency of
the created cause. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the positive entity or perfection</span></em> of this new
actuality can be produced only by the Infinite, Changeless, Inexhaustible
Source of all actuality, co-operating with the created
cause<a id="noteref_478" name="noteref_478" href="#note_478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">478</span></span></a> (<a href="#Section_103" class="tei tei-ref">103</a>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, it might be objected, perhaps created efficient causes
are themselves the adequate and absolutely independent principles
of the whole actuality of their effects? They cannot be such;
and that for the simple reason that they are not always <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in act</span></em>.
Were they such they should be always and necessarily in act:
they should always and necessarily contain in themselves, and
that actually and in an eminently perfect manner, all the perfections
of all the effects which they gradually produce in the universe.
But experience shows us that created causes are not always
acting, that their active power, their causality <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu primo</span></span>
is not to be identified with their action, their causality <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu
secundo</span></span>; and reason tells us that since this is so, since action is
something more than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active power</span></em>, since a cause acting has more
actuality than the same cause not acting, it must have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
determined or reduced to action by some actuality other than itself.
This surplus of actuality or perfection in an acting cause,
as compared with the same cause prior to its acting, is the Divine
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em>. In other words, an active power which is really distinct
from its action requires to be moved or reduced to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its</span></em> act (which
is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio</span></span>) no less than a passive potentiality required to be moved to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its</span></em> act (which is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passio</span></span>), by some really distinct actual being. A
created efficient cause, therefore, by passing from the state of rest,
or mere power to act, into the state of action, is perfected by
having its active power actualized, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> by the Divine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em>: in
this sense action is a perfection of the agent. But it is not an entitative
perfection of the latter's essence; it is not a permanent or
stable elevation or perfection of the latter's powers; it is not the
completion of any passive potentiality of the latter; nor therefore
is it properly speaking a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em> of the agent as such; it
is, as we have said already, rather an index of the latter's perfection
in the scale of real being.<a id="noteref_479" name="noteref_479" href="#note_479"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">479</span></span></a> Action really perfects the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">patiens</span></span>; and only when this is identical in its concrete individuality
with the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">agens</span></span> is the latter permanently perfected by
the action.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The action of created causes, therefore, depends on the
action of the First Cause. We derive our notion of action
from the former and apply it analogically to the latter. If we
compare them we shall find that, notwithstanding many differences,
the notion of action in general involves a <span class="tei tei-q">“simple”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“unmixed”</span>
perfection which can, without anthropomorphism, be applied
analogically to the Divine Action. The Divine Action is identical
with the Divine Power and the Divine Essence. In creatures
essence, power and action are really distinct. The Divine Action,
when creative, has not for its term a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em> in the strict sense (<a href="#Section_10" class="tei tei-ref">10</a>,
<a href="#Section_11" class="tei tei-ref">11</a>), for it produces being <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex nihilo</span></span>, whereas the action of creatures
cannot have for term the production of new being <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex nihilo</span></span>, but
only the change of pre-existing being. The Divine Action,
whether in creating or conserving or concurring with creatures,
implies in God no real transition from power to act; whereas
the action of creatures does imply such transition in them. Such
are the differences; but with them there is this point of agreement:
the Divine Action implies in God an efficiency which has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for its term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the origin of new being dependently on this efficiency</span></em>.<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href="#note_480"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">480</span></span></a>
So, too, does the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action of creatures</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Positive efficient influence on
the one side, and the origin, production, or </span><span class="tei tei-q">“fieri”</span><span style="font-style: italic"> of new actual
being on the other, with a relation of real dependence on this efficiency</span></em>:
such is the essential note of all efficient causality, whether
of God or of creatures.<a id="noteref_481" name="noteref_481" href="#note_481"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">481</span></span></a>

remains either within the very faculty which elicits it, affecting this

whereas every agency in the inorganic universe acts not upon itself,
but only on some other thing, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transitively</span></em>. But immanent
action, no less than transitive action, is productive of real change—not,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a name="Pg392" id="Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of course, in the physical sense in which this term is

and theories there are indeed in abundance. Some of these can be shown
to be false; and thus our knowledge of the real nature of action may be at least
negatively if not positively perfected. Our concept of action is derived, like

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
In analysing the nature of efficient causality we might be tempted to
think that we understood it by imagining some sort of a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">flow</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> or </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">transference</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">

We have no option in the matter, for all human language is based upon sense
consciousness of physical phenomena. When we describe efficiency as an

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Now when we reflect that the senses testify only to time and space sequences
and collocations of the phenomena which we regard as causally
connected, and when we feel convinced that there is something more than
this in the causal connexion,—which something more we describe in the terms
illustrated above,—we must inquire whether we have any rational ground for
thinking that this something more is really anything in the nature of a spatial
transference of some actual reality from </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">agens</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> to </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">patiens</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. There are indeed
many philosophers and scientists who seem to believe that there is such a
local transference of some actuality from cause to effect, that efficient causality
is explained by it, and cannot be intelligibly explained otherwise. As a
matter of fact there is no rational ground for believing in any such transference,
and even were there such transference, so far from its being the only intelligible
explanation of efficient causality, it would leave the whole problem entirely
unexplained—and not merely the problem of spiritual, immanent causality, to
which it is manifestly inapplicable, but even the problem of corporeal, transitive
causality.</span><a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href="#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
We have already referred at some length (</span><a href="#Section_9" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">9-11</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) to the philosophy which
has endeavoured to reduce all change, or at least all corporeal change, to
mechanical change; all qualities, powers, forces, energies of the universe, to
ultimate particles or atoms of matter in motion; and all efficient causality to
a flow or transference of spatial motion from particle to particle or from body
to body. A full analysis of all such theories belongs to Cosmology. But
we may recall a few of the more obvious considerations already urged against
them.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
In the first place, the attempt to explain all </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">qualities</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> in the material universe—all
the powers, forces, energies, of matter—by maintaining that objectively
and extramentally they are all purely </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">quantitative</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> realities, all spatial motions
of matter—does not explain the qualitative factors and distinctions in the
world of our sense experience at all, but simply transfers the problem of explaining
them from the philosophy of matter to the philosophy of mind, by
making them all subjective after the manner of Kant's analysis of experience
(</span><a href="#Section_11" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">11</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">).
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
In the second place, when we endeavour to conceive, to apprehend intellectually,
how </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">motion</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, or indeed any other physical or real entity, could actually
pass or be transferred from </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">agens</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> to </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">patiens</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, whether these be spatially
in contact or not, we find such a supposition positively unintelligible.
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
Motion is not a substance; and if it is an accident it cannot migrate from subject
to subject. The idea that corporeal efficient causality—even mechanical
causality—can be explained by such a transference of actual accidental modes
of being from </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">agens</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> to </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">patiens</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> is based on a very crude and erroneous conception
of what an accidental mode of being really is (</span><a href="#Section_65" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">65</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">).
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The more we reflect on the nature of real change in the universe, and of
the efficient causality whereby it is realized, the more convinced we must
become that there can be no satisfactory explanation of these facts which does
not recognize and take account of this great fundamental fact: that contingent
real being is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">not all actual</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, that it is partly potential and partly actual; that
therefore our concepts of </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">passive potentiality</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> and </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">active power</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> are not
mere subjective mental motions, with at best a mere regulative or systematizing
function (after the manner of Kant's philosophy), but that they are really
and objectively valid concepts—concepts which from the time of Aristotle have
given philosophers the only insight into the nature of efficient causality which is
at any rate satisfactory and intelligible as far as it goes.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Of this great fact the advocates of the mechanical theory of efficient
causality have, in the third place, failed to take account. And it is partly because
with the revival of atomism at the dawn of modern philosophy this
traditional Aristotelian conception of contingent being as potential and actual
was lost sight of (</span><a href="#Section_64" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">64</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">), that such a crude and really unintelligible account of
efficient causality, as a </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">flow of motion,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> has been able to find such continued
and widespread acceptance.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Another reason of the prevalence of this tendency to </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">explain</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> all physical
efficient causality as a propagation of spatial motions of matter is to be

only explanation of it within reach of the human mind, if we are to accept their
view of the matter—the exponent of the traditional metaphysics more modestly
confines himself to setting forth the inevitable implications of the fact of
efficient causality, and, without purporting to offer any positive explanation of
the real nature of action or efficient influence, he is content to supplement his
analysis negatively by pointing out the unintelligible and illusory character of
their proffered </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">explanations</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
In the exact methods of the physical sciences, their quantitative evaluation
of all corporeal forces whether mechanical, physical, or chemical, in terms
of mechanical work, which is measured by the motion of matter through
space, and in the great physical generalization known as the law of the
equivalence of energies, or of the equality of action and reaction,—we can
detect yet further apparent reasons for the conception of efficient causality as
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id="Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
a mere transference or interchange of actual physical and measurable entities
among bodies. It is an established fact not only that all corporeal agents
gradually lose their energy or power of action by actually exercising this
power, but that this loss of energy is in direct proportion to the amount of energy
gained by the recipients of their action; and this fact would naturally suggest
the mental picture of a transference of some actual measurable entity from
cause to effect. But it does not necessarily imply such transference—even if
the latter were intelligible, which, as we have seen, it is not. The fact is
quite intelligibly explained by the natural supposition that in proportion as
the </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">agens</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> exhausts its active power by exercise the </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">patiens</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> gains in some
form of actuality. Similarly, the fact that all forms of corporeal energy can
be measured in terms of mechanical energy does not at all imply that they all
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">really are</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> mechanical energy, but only that natural agents can by the use of
one form of energy produce another form in equivalent quantity. And finally,
the law of the conservation of corporeal energy in the universe is explained
by the law of the equality of action and reaction, and without recourse to
the unintelligible supposition that this sum-total of energy is one unchanging
and unchangeable </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actuality</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
There is just one other consideration which at first sight appears to favour
the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">transference</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> theory of causality, but which on analysis shows how illusory
the proffered explanation is, and how unintelligible the simplest phenomenon
of change must be to those who fail to grasp the profound significance of the
principle that all real being which is subject to change must of necessity be
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">partly potential and partly actual</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. We allude to the general assumption of
physical scientists that corporeal action of whatsoever kind takes place </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">only
on contact</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, whether mediate or immediate, between the bodies in question.</span><a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
Now it is well to bear in mind that this is not a self-evident truth or principle,
but only an hypothesis, a very legitimate hypothesis and one which works
admirably, but still only an hypothesis. It implies the assumption that some
sort of substance—called the universal ether—actually exists and fills all space,
serving as a medium for the action of gravitation, light, radiant heat,
electricity and magnetism, between the earth and the other planets, the sun
and the stars. This whole supposition is the only thinkable alternative to
</span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actio in distans</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. If those bodies really act on one another—and the fact that
they do is undeniable,—and if there were no such medium between them, then
the causal influence of one body should be able to produce an effect in another
body spatially distant from, and not physically connected by any material
medium with, the former. Hence two questions: Is this alternative, </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actio in
distans</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, imaginable? </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> can we form any </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">positive imagination image</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">how</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> this would take place? And secondly: Is it </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">thinkable</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">conceivable</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">,
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">intrinsically possible</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">? We need not hesitate to answer the former question
in the negative. But as to the latter question all we can say is that we have
never met any cogent proof of the intrinsic impossibility of </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actio in distans</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.
The efficient action of a finite cause implies that it has active power and is
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
conserved in existence with this power by the Creator or First Cause, that
this power is reduced to act by the Divine </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">concursus</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, and that </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">dependently
on this cause so acting</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> some change takes place, some potentiality is actualized
in some other finite being. Nothing more than this is involved in the general
concept of efficient causality. Of course real influence on the one side, and
real dependence on the other, imply some </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">real</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> connexion of cause with effect.
But is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">spatial</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> connexion a necessary condition of real connexion? Is a
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">physical</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">phenomenal</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">imaginable</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">efflux</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of some entity out of the cause into
the effect, either immediately or through some medium as a channel, a
necessary condition for real influence? There is nothing of the kind in
spiritual causality; and to demand anything of the kind for causality in
general would be to make imagination, not thought, the test and measure
of the real. But perhaps </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">spatial</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> connexion is essential to the real connexion
involved in </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">this particular kind</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of causality, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">corporeal</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> causality? Perhaps.
But it has never been proved. Too little is known about the reality of space,
about the ultimate nature of material phenomena and their relation to our
minds, to justify anything like dogmatism on such an ultimate question. It
may well be that if we had a deeper insight into these things we could pronounce
</span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actio in distans</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> to be absolutely incompatible with the essences of
the things which do as a matter of fact constitute the actual corporeal universe.
But in the absence of such insight we cannot pronounce </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actio in distans</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> to
be intrinsically impossible. Physical scientists assume that as a matter of
fact bodies do not act </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">in distans</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. Granted the assumption to be correct, it
still remains an open question whether by a miracle they could act </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">in distans</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> whether or not such action would be incompatible with their nature as
finite corporeal causes.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Owing to a very natural tendency to rest in imagination images we are
inclined not only to pronounce as impossible any process the mode of which
is not positively imaginable, but also to think that we rightly understand a
process once we have provided ourselves with an imagination image of it—when
as a matter of fact this image may cover an entirely groundless conception
or theory of the process. Hence the fairly prevalent idea that while </span><span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">actio
in distans</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> is impossible, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">the interaction of bodies on contact</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> is perfectly intelligible
and presents no difficulties. When a billiard ball in motion strikes
another at rest it communicates some or all of its motion to the other, and
that is all: nothing simpler! And then all the physical, chemical, and substantial
changes in the material universe are reducible to this common
denominator! The atomic philosophy, with its two modest postulates of
matter and motion, is a delightfully simple philosophy; but unfortunately for its
philosophical prestige </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">it does not explain causality or change</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. Nor can these
facts be explained by any philosophy which ignores the most elementary implication
of all real change: the implication that changing reality involves
real passive potentialities and real active powers or forces in the phenomena
which constitute the changing reality of the universe.

have established the objective validity of the

of the concept, have maintained that no creature, or at least no
corporeal creature, can be an efficient cause. Efficient influence
is, in their view, incompatible with the nature of a corporeal
substance: only spiritual substances can be efficient causes:
corporeal things, conditions, and happenings, are all only the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">occasions</span></em> on which spiritual substances act efficiently in and
through all created nature. Hence the name of the theory:
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Occasionalism</span></em>. There are two forms of it: the milder, which
admits that created spirits or minds are efficient causes; and the
more extreme view, according to which no creature can be an
efficient cause, inasmuch as efficient causality is essentially a
Divine attribute, a prerogative of the Divinity.

This error was not unknown in the Middle Ages,<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a> but it was
in the seventeenth century that certain disciples of Descartes,—Geulincx
(1625-1669) and Malebranche (1638-1715),—expressly
inferred it from the Cartesian antithesis of matter and spirit
and the Cartesian doctrine that matter is essentially inert, or
inactive. According to the gratuitous and unproven assertion
laid down by Geulincx as a principle: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quod nescis quomodo fiat</span></span>,

know <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> these take place; nor can bodies cause them, any more
than our own created spirits, inasmuch as bodies are essentially

from the universal belief of mankind, based on the testimony

concession of at least immanent activity to the will is at all events
an admission that there is in the nature of the creature as such

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) Although Malebranche bases his philosophy mainly on
deductive, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> reasonings from a consideration of the Divine
attributes, his system is really derogatory to the perfection of the
First Cause, and especially to the Divine Wisdom. To say, for
instance, that God created an organ so well adapted to discharge
the function of seeing as the human eye, and then to deny that the
latter discharges this or any function, is tantamount to accusing
God of folly. There is no reason in this system why any created
thing or condition of things would be even the appropriate
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">occasion</span></em> of the First Cause producing any definite effect. Everything
would be an equally appropriate occasion, or rather nothing
would be in any intelligible sense an appropriate occasion, for
any exercise of the Divine causality. The admirable order of
the universe—with its unity in variety, its adaptation of means to
ends, its gradation of created perfections—is an intelligible
manifestation of the Divine perfections on the assumption that
creatures efficiently co-operate with the First Cause in realizing
and maintaining this order. But if they were all inert, inoperative,
useless for this purpose, what could be the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'être</span></span> of
their diversified endowments and perfections? So far from manifesting
the wisdom, power and goodness of God they would
evidence an aimless and senseless prodigality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) Occasionalism imperils the distinction between creatures
and a personal God. Although Malebranche, fervent catholic
that he was, protested against the pantheism of <span class="tei tei-q">“le misérable
Spinoza,”</span> his own system contains the undeveloped germ of this
pernicious error. For, if creatures are not efficient causes not
only are their variety and multiplicity meaningless, as contributing
nothing towards the order of the universe, but their very existence
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as distinct realities</span></em> seems to have no <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'être</span></span>. Malebranche
emphasizes the truth that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God does nothing useless</span></em>: <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Dieu ne fait
rien d'inutile</span></span>. Very well. If, then, a being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does nothing</span></em>, what
purpose is served by its existence? Of what use is it? What
is the measure of a creature's reality, if not its action and its
power of action? So intimately in fact is this notion of causality
bound up with the notion of the very reality of things that the
concept of an absolutely inert, inactive reality is scarcely intelligible.
It is almost an axiom in scholastic philosophy that every
nature has its correlative activity, every being its operation:
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Omne ens est propter suam operationem; Omnis natura ordinatur
ad propriam operationem</span></span>. Hence if what we call creatures had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
really no proper activity distinct from that of the First Cause, on
what grounds could we suppose them to have a real and proper
existence of their own distinct from the reality of the Infinite
Being? Or who could question the lawfulness of the inference
that they are not really creatures, but only so many phases, aspects,
manifestations of the one and sole existing reality? Which is
Pantheism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) Occasionalism leads to Subjective Idealism by destroying
all ground for the objective validity of human science. How
do we know the real natures of things? By reasoning from their
activities in virtue of the principle, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Operari sequitur esse</span></span>.<a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499" href="#note_499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">499</span></span></a> But if
things have no activities, no operations, such reasoning is illusory.
How, for instance, do we justify by rational demonstration,
in opposition to subjectivism, the common-sense interpretation
of the data of sense consciousness as revealing to us the real and
extramental existence of a material universe? By arguing, in
virtue of the principle of causality, from our consciousness of our
own passivity in external sense perception, to the real existence
of bodies outside our minds, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">excitants</span></em> of our cognitive activity
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">partial causes</span></em> of these conscious, perceptive processes. But
if occasionalism were true such inference would be illusory, and
we should infer, with Berkeley, that only God and minds exist,
but not any material universe. Malebranche admits the possible
validity of this inference to immaterialism from his principles, and
grounds his own belief in the existence of an external material
universe solely on faith in Divine Revelation.<a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500" href="#note_500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">500</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We reply that while the absolutely independent causality of
the First Cause is essentially Divine, another kind or order of
causality, dependent on the former, but none the less real, can
be and is communicated to creatures. And just as the fact that
creatures have real being, real existence, distinct from, but dependent
on, the existence of the Infinite Being, does not derogate
from the supremacy of the latter, so the fact that creatures have
real efficient causality, distinct from, but dependent on, the
causality of the First Cause, does not derogate from the latter's
supremacy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) They urge that efficient causality is creative, and therefore
infinite and incommunicable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We reply that there is a plain distinction between creative
activity and the efficient activity we claim for creatures. Creation
is the production of new being from nothingness. God alone,
the Infinite Being, can create; and, furthermore, according to
the common view of Theistic philosophers a creature cannot
even be an instrument of the First Cause in this production of
new being from nothingness. And the main reason for this
appears to be that the efficiency of the creature, acting, of
course, with the Divine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em>, necessarily presupposes some
pre-existing being as material on which to operate, and is confined
to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">determination of new forms or modes</span></em> of this
pre-existing reality. Such efficiency, subordinate to the Divine
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em> and limited to such an order of effects, is plainly distinct
from creative activity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) But the creature, acting with the Divine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em>, either
contributes something real and positive to the effect or contributes
nothing. The former alternative is inadmissible, for God
is the cause of everything real and positive: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">omne novum ens est
a Deo</span></span>. And in the latter alternative, which is the true one, the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em> is superfluous; God does all; and creatures are not
really efficient causes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We reply that the former alternative, not the latter, is the
true one. But the former alternative does not imply that the
creature produces any new reality <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">independently of the First
Cause</span></em>; nor is it incompatible with the truth that God is the
author and cause of all positive reality: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">omne novum ens est a
Deo</span></span>. No doubt, were we to conceive the co-operation of God
and the creature after the manner of the co-operation of two partial
causes of the same order, producing by their joint efficiency
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg 402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
some one total effect—like the co-operation of two horses drawing
a cart,—it would follow that the creature's share of the joint
effect would be independent of the Divine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em> and attributable
to the creature alone, that the creature would produce
some reality independently of the First Cause. But that is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>
the way in which the First Cause concurs with created causes.
They are not partial causes of the same order. Each is a total
cause in its own order. They so co-operate that God, besides
having created and now conserving the second cause, and
moving the latter's power to act, produces Himself the whole
effect directly and immediately by the efficiency of His <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em>;
while at the same time the second cause, thus reduced to act,
and acting with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em>, also directly and immediately produces
the whole effect. There is one effect, one change <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in facto
esse</span></span>, one change <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in fieri</span></span>, and therefore one action as considered
in the subject changed, since the action takes place in this
latter: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio fit in passo</span></span>. This change, this action considered
thus passively, or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in passo</span></span>,”</span> is the total term of each efficiency,
the Divine and the created, not partly of the one and partly of
the other. It is one and indivisible; it is wholly due to, and
wholly attained by, each efficiency; not, however, under the same
formal aspect. We may distinguish in it two formalities: it is a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">novum ens</span></span>, a new actuality, something positive and actual superadded
to the existing order of real, contingent being; but it is
not <span class="tei tei-q">“being in general”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“actuality in general,”</span> it is some
specifically, nay individually, determinate mode of actuality or
actual being. We have seen that it is precisely because every
real effect has the former aspect that it demands for its adequate
explanation, and as its only intelligible source, the presence and
influence of a purely actual, unchanging, infinite, inexhaustible
productive principle of all actual contingent reality: hence the
necessity and efficacy of the Divine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em>. And similarly
it is because the new actuality involved in every change is an
individually definite mode of actuality that we can detect in it
the need for, and the efficacy of, the created cause: the nature
of this latter, the character and scope and intensity of its active
power is what determines the individuality of the total result,
to the total production of which it has by the aid of the Divine
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus</span></em> attained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) But God can Himself produce the total result <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">under both
formalities</span></em> without any efficiency of the creature. Therefore the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
difficulty remains that the latter efficiency is superfluous and useless:
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We reply that as a matter of fact the effects produced in the
ordinary course of nature are produced by God under both
formalities; but also by the created cause under both formalities:
inasmuch as the formalities are but mentally distinct aspects of
one real result which is, as regards its extrinsic causes, individual
and indivisible. The distinction of these formal aspects only
helps us to realize how <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> such an effect is due to the cooperation
of the First Cause and created causes. That God <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em>
produce all such effects without any created causes—we must
distinguish. Some such effects He could not produce without
created causes, for such production would be self-contradictory.
He could not produce, for instance, a volition except as the act
of a created will, or a thought except as the act of a created
intellect, or a vital change except as the act of a living creature.
But apart from such cases which would involve an intrinsic impossibility,
God could of course produce, without created agents,
the effects which He does produce through their created efficiency.
It is, however, not a question of what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could be</span></em>, but of what
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually is</span></em>. And we think that the arguments already set forth
prove conclusively that creatures are not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> the inert, inactive,
aimless and unmeaning things they would be if Occasionalism
were the true interpretation of the universe of our actual
experience; but that these creatures are in a true sense efficient
causes, and that just as by their very co-existence with God, as
contingent beings, they do not derogate from His Infinite
Actuality but rather show forth His Infinity, so by their cooperation
with Him as subordinate and dependent efficient causes
they do not derogate from His supremacy as First Cause, but
rather show forth the infinite and inexhaustible riches of His
Wisdom and Omnipotence.

universe demands for its explanation certain real principles, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>
passive potentiality, actualization, and active power or efficiency;
in other words that it points to material, formal and efficient
causes. Do these principles suffice to explain the course of
nature to the inquiring mind? Mechanists say, Yes; these
principles explain it so far as it is capable of explanation.
Teleologists say, No; these principles do not of themselves account
for the universe of our experience: this universe reveals itself as
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>: hence it demands for its explanation real principles or
causes of another sort, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final causes</span></em>, the existence of which implies
purpose, plan or design, and therefore also intelligence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The problem whether or not the universe manifests the existence
and influence of final causes has been sometimes formulated
in this striking fashion: Is it that birds have wings in order to
fly, or is it merely that they fly because they have wings? Such
a graphic statement of the problem is misleading, for it suggests
that the alternatives are mutually exclusive, that we must vote
either for final causes or for efficient causes. As a matter of
fact we accept both. Efficient causes account for the course of
nature; but they need to be determined by the influence of final
causes. Moreover, the question how far this influence of final
causes extends—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">finality</span></em> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finalitas</span></span>), as it is technically termed—is a
secondary question; nor does the advocate of final causality in
the universe undertake to decide its nature and scope in every
instance and detail, any more than the physical scientist does to
point out all the physical laws embodied in an individual natural
event, or the biologist to say whether a doubtful specimen of
matter is organic or inorganic, or whether a certain sort of living
cell is animal or vegetable. The teleologist's thesis, as against that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of mechanism, is simply that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there are final causes in the universe,
that the universe does really manifest the presence and influence of
final causes</span></em>.<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href="#note_501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are two ways, however, of conceiving this influence
as permeating the universe. The conception of final causality
in general is, as we shall see, the conception of acting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for an end</span></em>,
from a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motive</span></em>, with a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purpose</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plan</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">design</span></em> for the attainment of
something. It implies arrangement, ordination, adaptation of
means to ends (<a href="#Section_55" class="tei tei-ref">55</a>). Now at least there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appears</span></em> to be, pervading
the universe everywhere and directing its activities, such an
adaptation. The admirable equilibrium of forces which secures the
regular motions of the heavenly bodies; the exact mixture of
gases which makes our atmosphere suitable for organic life; the
distance and relative positions of the sun and the earth, which
secure conditions favourable to organic life; the chemical transformations
whereby inorganic elements and compounds go to form
the living substance of plants and are thus prepared for assimilation
as food by animal organisms; the wonderfully graded
hierarchy of living species in the animate world, and the mutual
interdependence of plants and animals; the endless variety of
instincts which secure the preservation and well-being of
living individuals and species; most notably the adaptability and
adaptation of other mundane creatures to human uses by man himself,—innumerable
facts such as these convince us that the things of
the universe are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">useful to one another</span></em>, that they are constituted
and disposed in relation to one another <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as if they had been
deliberately chosen</span></em> to suit one another, to fit in harmoniously together
in mutual co-ordination and subordination so that by their
interaction and interdependence they work out a plan or design
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subserve as means to definite ends</span></em>. This suitability of things
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relatively to one another</span></em>, this harmony of the nature and activity
of each with the nature and activity of every other, we may
designate as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em> finality. The Creator has willed so to
arrange and dispose all creatures in conditions of space and time
that such harmonious but purely extrinsic relations of mutual
adaptation do <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> obtain and continue to prevail between
them under His guidance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But are these creatures themselves, in their own individual
natures, equally indifferent to any definite mode of action, so that
the orderly concurrence of their activities is due to an initial collocation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and impulse divinely impressed upon them from without,
and not to any purposive principle intrinsic to themselves individually?
Descartes, Leibniz and certain supporters of the theory of
atomic dynamism regarding the constitution of matter, while recognizing
a relative and extrinsic finality in the universe in the
sense explained, seem to regard the individual agencies of the
universe as mere efficient causes, not of themselves endowed with
any immanent, intrinsic directive principle of their activities, and
so contributing by mere extrinsic arrangement to the order of the
universe. Scholastic philosophers, on the contrary, following the
thought of Aristotle,<a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502" href="#note_502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a> consider that every agency in the universe
is endowed with an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic principle of finality</span></em> which constantly
directs its activities towards the realization of a perfection which
is proper to it and which constitutes its intrinsic end (<a href="#Section_45" class="tei tei-ref">45-46</a>). And
while each thus tends to its own proper perfection by the natural
play of its activities, each is so related to all others that they simultaneously
realize the extrinsic purpose which consists in the order
and harmony of the whole universe. Thus the extrinsic and relative
finality whereby all conspire to constitute the universe a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>
is secondary and posterior and subordinate to the deeper, intrinsic,
immanent and absolute finality whereby each individual created
nature moves by a tendency or law of its being towards the realization
of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfects</span></em> it as its natural end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In order to understand the nature of this intrinsic and extrinsic
finality in the universe, and to vindicate its existence against
the philosophy of Mechanism, we must next analyse the concept,
and investigate the influence, of what are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final causes</span></em>.

107. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Concept of Final Cause; its Objective
Validity in all Nature. Classification of Final Causes.</span></span>—When
we speak of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> of the year, or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> of a wall, we
mean the extreme limit or ultimate point; and the term conveys
no notion of a cause. Similarly, were a person to say <span class="tei tei-q">“I have
got to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> of my work,”</span> we should understand him to mean
simply that he had finished it. But when people act deliberately
and as intelligent beings, they usually act for some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conscious purpose</span></em>,
with some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object in view</span></em>, for the achievement or attainment
of something; they continue to act until they have attained this
object; when they have attained it they cease to act; its attainment
synchronizes with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> of their action, taking this term in
the sense just illustrated. Probably this is the reason why the term
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> has been extended from its original sense to signify the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object</span></em> for the attainment of which an intelligent agent acts. This
object of conscious desire <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">induces</span></em> the agent to seek it; and because
it thus influences the agent to act it verifies the notion of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>:
it is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final cause</span></em>, an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> in the causal sense. For instance, a young
man wishes to become a medical doctor: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">art of healing</span></em> is the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> he wishes to secure. For this purpose he pursues a course of
studies and passes certain examinations; these acts whereby he
qualifies himself by obtaining a certain fund of knowledge and
skill are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">means</span></em> to the end intended by him. He need not desire
these preparatory labours <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for their own sake</span></em>; but he does desire
them as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">useful for his purpose</span></em>, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">means</span></em> to his end: in so far as
he wills them as means he wills them not for their own sake but
because of the end, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">propter finem</span></span>. He <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apprehends</span></em> the end as a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>; he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intends</span></em> its attainment; he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">elects</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">selects</span></em> certain acts or
lines of action as means suitable for this purpose. An end or final
cause, therefore, may be defined as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something apprehended as
a good, and which, because desired as such, influences the will to
choose some action or line of action judged necessary or useful for the
attainment of this good</span></em>. Hence Aristotle's definition of end as
τὸ οὖ ἕνεκα: id cujus gratia aliquid fit: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that for the sake of which
an agent acts</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The end understood in this sense is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motive</span></em> of action; not
only would the action not take place without the agent's intending
the end, showing the latter to be a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">conditio sine qua non</span></span>; but,
more than this, the end as a good, apprehended and willed, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has a
positive influence</span></em> on the ultimate effect or issue, so that it is really
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Man is conscious of this <span class="tei tei-q">“finality,”</span> or influence of final causes
on his own deliberate actions. As an intelligent being he acts <span class="tei tei-q">“for
ends,”</span> and orders or regulates his actions as means to those ends;
so much so that when we see a man's acts, his whole conduct,
utterly unrelated to rational ends, wholly at variance and out of
joint with the usual ends of intelligent human activity, we take
it as an indication of loss of reason, insanity. Furthermore, man
is free; he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chooses</span></em> the ends for which he acts; he acts <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">electivé

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in the domain of animal life and activity is there any
evidence of the influence of final causes? Most undoubtedly.
Watch the movements of animals seeking their prey; observe
the wide domain of animal instincts; study the elaborate and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
intricate lines of action whereby they protect and foster and preserve
their lives, and rear their young and propagate their species:
could there be clearer or more abundant evidence that in all this
conduct they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">influenced</span></em> by objects which they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apprehend</span></em> and
seek as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensible goods</span></em>? Not that they can conceive in the abstract
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ratio bonitatis</span></span> in these things, or freely choose them as good, for
they are incapable of abstract thought and consequent free choice;
but that these sensible objects, apprehended by them in the concrete,
do really influence or move their sense appetites to desire
and seek them; and the influence of an object on sense appetite
springs from the goodness of this object (<a href="#Section_44" class="tei tei-ref">44</a>, <a href="#Section_45" class="tei tei-ref">45</a>). They tend
towards <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apprehended</span></em> goods; they act <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">apprehensivé propter fines</span></span>.<a id="noteref_503" name="noteref_503" href="#note_503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">503</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, even in the domains of unconscious agencies, of plant
life and inorganic nature, we have evidence of the influence of
final causes. For here too we witness innumerable varied, complex,
ever-renewed activities, constantly issuing in results useful
to, and good for, the agents which elicit them: operations which
contribute to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">development</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfection</span></em> of the natures of these
agents (<a href="#Section_46" class="tei tei-ref">46</a>). Now if similar effects demand similar causes how
can we refuse to recognize even in these activities of physical
nature the influence of final causes? Whenever and wherever we
find a great and complex variety of active powers, forces, energies,
issuing invariably in effects which suit and develop and perfect
the agents in question,—in a word, which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> for these
agents,—whether the latter be conscious or unconscious, does
not reason itself dictate to us that all such domains of action
must be subject to the influence of final causes? Of course it
would be mere unreflecting anthropomorphism to attribute to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unconscious</span></em> agencies a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conscious</span></em> subjection to the attracting and
directing influence of such causes. But the recognition of such
influence in this domain implies no naïve supposition of that
sort. It does, however, imply this very reasonable view: that
there must be some reason or ground in the nature or constitution
of even an inanimate agent for its acting always in a uniform
manner, conducive to its own development and perfection;

vast multitude of such agents which make up the whole physical
universe a reason or ground for each co-operating constantly and
harmoniously with all the others to secure and preserve that
general order and regularity which enables us to pronounce the
universe not a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chaos</span></em> but a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>. Now that ground or reason
in things, whereby they act in such a manner—not indifferently,
chaotically, capriciously, aimlessly, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unintelligibly</span></em>, but definitely,
regularly, reliably, purposively, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligibly</span></em>—is a real principle of
their natures, impressing on their natures a definite tendency,
directive of their activities towards results which, as being suited
to these natures, bear to these latter the relation of final causes.
A directive principle need not itself be conscious; the inner
directive principle of inanimate agents towards what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> for
them, what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfects</span></em> them, what is therefore in a true and real
sense their end (<a href="#Section_45" class="tei tei-ref">45</a>, <a href="#Section_46" class="tei tei-ref">46</a>), is not conscious. But in virtue of it
they act as if they were conscious, nay intelligent, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> they act

We conclude then that what we call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">finality</span></em>, or the influence
of final causes, pervades the whole universe; that in the domain
of conscious agents it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conscious</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">instinctive</span></em> when it solicits
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sense appetite</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em> when it solicits <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligent will</span></em>; that in

naturalis</span></span>”</span> of these agencies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before inquiring into the nature of final causality we may
indicate briefly the main divisions of final causes: some of these
concern the domain of human activity and are of importance to
Ethics rather than to Ontology.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) We have already distinguished between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em> finality. An intrinsic final cause is an end or object
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg 410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which perfects the nature itself of the agent which tends towards
it: nourishment, for instance, is an intrinsic end in relation to
the living organism. An extrinsic final cause is not one towards
which the nature of the agent immediately tends, but one which,
intended by some other agent, is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> realized by the tendency
of the former towards its own intrinsic end. Thus, the general
order of the universe is an extrinsic end in relation to each
individual agency in the universe: it is an end intended by the
Creator and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> realized by each individual agency acting in
accordance with its own particular nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Very similar to this is the familiar distinction between
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finis operis</span></span> and the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finis operantis</span></span>. The former is the end
necessarily and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> realized by the act itself, by its very
nature, independently of any other end the agent may have
expressly intended to attain by means of it. The latter is the
end expressly intended by the agent, and which may vary for
one and the same kind of act. For instance, the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finis operis</span></span> of
an act of almsgiving is the actual aiding of the mendicant; the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finis operantis</span></span> may be charity, or self-denial, or vanity, or whatever
other motive influences the giver.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Akin to those also is the distinction between an unconscious,
or physical, or <span class="tei tei-q">“natural”</span> end, and a conscious, or mental,
or <span class="tei tei-q">“intentional”</span> end. The former is that towards which the
nature or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">appetitus naturalis</span></span>”</span> of unconscious agencies tends;
the latter is an end apprehended by a conscious agent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) An end may be either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ultimate</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proximate</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intermediate</span></em>.
An ultimate end is one which is sought for its own
sake, as contrasted with an intermediate end which is willed
rather as a means to the former, and with a proximate end which
is intended last and sought first as a means to realizing the
others. It should be noted that proximate and intermediate
ends, in so far as they are sought for the sake of some ulterior
end, are not ends at all but rather means; only in so far as they
present some good desirable for its own sake, are they properly
ends, or final causes. Furthermore, an ultimate end may be such
absolutely or relatively: absolutely if it cannot possibly be subordinated
or referred to any ulterior or higher good; relatively
if, though ultimate in a particular order as compared with means
leading up to it, it is nevertheless capable of being subordinated
to a higher good, though not actually referred to this latter by
any explicit volition of the agent that seeks it.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) We can regard the end for which an agent acts either
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectively</span></em>,—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finis</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">objectivus</span></span>,”</span>—or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em>,—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finis</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formalis</span></span>”</span>.
The former is the objective good itself which the agent wishes
to realize, possess or enjoy; the latter is the act whereby the
agent formally secures, appropriates, unites himself with, this
objective good. Thus, God Himself is the objective happiness
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">beatitudo objectiva</span></span>) of man, while man's actual possession of, or
union with, God, by knowledge and love, is man's formal happiness
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">beatitudo formalis</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span>) We may distinguish also between the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> end (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finis</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qui</span></span>”</span>
or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cujus</span></span>”</span>, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal</span></em> end (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finis</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cui</span></span>”</span>). The former is
the good <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em> the agent desires, the good for the sake of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cujus</span></span>”</span> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia</span></span>) he acts. The latter is the subject or person <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to
whom</span></em> he wishes this good, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for whom</span></em> he wishes to procure it.
Thus, a labourer may work to earn <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a sustenance</span></em> for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">himself</span></em> or also
for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his family</span></em>. The real and the personal end are never willed
separately, but always as one concrete good.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>) The distinction between a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principal</span></em> end and an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accessory</span></em>
end (motivum <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">impulsivum</span></span>”</span>) is obvious. The former can move to
act of itself without the latter, but the latter strengthens the influence
of the former. A really charitable person, while efficaciously
moved to give alms by sympathy with the poor, may
not be uninfluenced by vanity to let others know of his charity.

(</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">h</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">) Finally we may note the theological distinction between the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">natural</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
end, and the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">supernatural</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> end, of man as a rational and moral agent. The
former is the end </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">due</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> to man's nature, the latter is an end which is gratuitous
and undue to his nature. God might not have created the world or man, and
in this sense even the natural end of man is a gratuitous gift of God; but
granted that God did decree to create the world and man, an end corresponding
to man's nature and powers was due to him: the knowledge, service
and love of God as known to man by the light of natural reason. But as
a matter of fact God, in His actual providence, has decreed for man an incomparably
higher and purely gratuitous end, an end revealed to man by
God Himself, an end entirely undue not only to man but to any and
every possible creature: the Beatific Vision of the Divine Essence for ever in
heaven.

108. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Causality of the Final Cause; Relation of the
Latter to Efficient, Formal, and Material Causes.</span></span>—We
can best analyse the influence of the final cause by studying this
influence as exerted on conscious and intelligent agents. The
final cause has a positive influence of some sort on the production,
happening, actualization of effects. What is the nature of
this influence? The final cause exerts its influence by being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a name="Pg412" id="Pg412" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
good</span></em>, an apprehended good; it exerts this influence on the appetite
of the agent, soliciting the latter to perform certain acts for
the realization, attainment, possession, or enjoyment of this
good. But it must not be conceived as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient cause</span></em> of this
movement of the appetite, nor may its influence be conceived as
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em>. An efficient cause must actually exist in order to act;
but when the final cause, as an apprehended good, exerts its
influence on the appetite <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it is not yet actual</span></em>: not until the agent,
by his action, has realized the end and actually attained it, does
the end, as a good, actually exist. We must distinguish between
the end <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as attained</span></em> and the end <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as intended</span></em>, between the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finis in
executione</span></span> and the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finis in intentione</span></span>. It is not the end as attained
that is a final cause; as attained it is an effect pure and simple.
It is the end as intended that is a final cause; and as intended it
does not yet actually exist: hence its influence cannot be by
way of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em>. Perhaps it is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cognition</span></em> of the intended
end that exerts the peculiar influence of final cause? No; the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cognition</span></em> of the end actually exists, no doubt, in the conscious
agent, but this is only a condition, a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">conditio sine qua non</span></span>,
for the apprehended good, the final cause, to exert its influence:
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nil volitum nisi praecognitum</span></span>. It is not the cognition of the good,
however, that moves the agent to act, it is not the idea of the
good that the agent desires or strives for, but the good itself.
It is the good itself, the known good, that exerts the influence,
and this influence consists in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive inclination</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">attraction</span></em>
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tendency</span></em> of the appetite towards the good: a tendency which
necessarily results from the very presence of the good (not really
or physically of course, but representatively, mentally, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intentionally</span></em>,”</span>
by <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse intentionale</span></span>”</span>; cf. <a href="#Section_4" class="tei tei-ref">4</a>) in the agent's consciousness,
and which is formally the actualization of the causal power or
influence of the final cause. <span class="tei tei-q">“Just as the efficient cause influences
by acting,”</span> says St. Thomas,<a id="noteref_504" name="noteref_504" href="#note_504"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">504</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“so the final cause influences by
being yearned for and desired”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Looked at from the side of the agent that undergoes it, this
influence is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive yielding</span></em>: this next becomes an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active</span></em>
motion of appetite; and in the case of free will a deliberate act
of intending the end, followed by acts of choosing means, and
finally by acts commanding the executive faculties to employ
these means.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Looked at from the side of the final cause, the influence consists
in an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">attraction</span></em> of appetite towards union with itself as a good.
The matter cannot be analysed much further; nor will imagination
images help us here any more than in the case of efficient
causality. It must be noted, however, that the influence of the
final cause is the influence not of a reality as actual, or in its <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse
actuale</span></span>, but of a reality as present to a perceiving mind, or in its
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse intentionale</span></span>. At the same time it would be a mistake to
infer from this that the influence of the final cause is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>.
It is sometimes described as <span class="tei tei-q">“intentional”</span> causality, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causalitas
intentionalis</span></span>”</span>; but this must not be taken to mean that it is not
real: for it is not the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse intentionale</span></span>”</span> of the good, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the
cognition of the good, its presence in the mind or consciousness
of the agent, that moves the latter's appetite: it is the apprehended
good, apprehended <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as real</span></em>, as possible of actual attainment, that
moves the agent to act. The influence may not be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> in
the sense of being productive of, or interchangeable with, or measurable
by, corporeal energy, or in terms of mechanical work; nor is
it; but it is none the less real.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if the influence of a final cause really reaches to the effect
of the agent's actions only through the medium of the latter's
appetite, and therefore through a link of <span class="tei tei-q">“intentional”</span> causality,
does it not at once follow that the attribution of final causality to
the domain of unconscious and inorganic activities, can be at
best merely metaphorical? The attribution to such agencies of
an <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">appetitus naturalis</span></span>”</span> is intelligible indeed as a striking and
perhaps not unpoetic metaphor. But to contend that it is anything
more than a metaphor, to claim seriously that inanimate
agencies are swayed and influenced by <span class="tei tei-q">“ends,”</span>—is not this really
to substitute mysticism and mystery for rational speculation and
analysis?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mechanists are wont to dismiss the doctrine of final causes
in the physical universe with offhand charges of this kind. They
are but too ready to attribute it to a mystical attitude of mind.
Final causes, they say, are not discovered in inanimate nature by
the cold, calculating, unemotional analysis to which reason submits
its activities, but are read into it by minds which allow themselves
to be prompted by the imagination and emotions to personify and
anthropomorphize inanimate agencies. The accusation is as plausible
as it is unjust. It is plausible because the attribution of final
causes to inanimate nature, and of an <span class="tei tei-q">“appetitus <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">naturalis</span></span>”</span> to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its agencies, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seems</span></em> to imply the recognition of conscious, mental,
<span class="tei tei-q">“intentional”</span> influence in this domain. But it really implies
nothing of the sort; and hence the injustice of the charge. What
it does imply is the existence of a genuine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">analogy</span></em> between the
nature and natural activities of physical agencies on the one hand
and the appetite and appetitive activities of conscious agencies on
the other. The existence of this analogy is absolutely undeniable.
The orderly, invariable and uniformly suitable character of physical
activities, simply forces our reason to recognize in physical
agencies <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natures</span></em> which tend towards their development, and
which by their activities attain to what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> for them, to what
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfects</span></em> them. In other words we have to recognize that each by
its natural line of activity attains to results that are good and
useful to it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">just as if</span></em> it apprehended them as such and consciously
tended towards them. The analogy is there; and the recognition
of it, so far from being a <span class="tei tei-q">“mystic”</span> interpretation of facts, is an
elementary logical exercise of our reasoning faculty. The scholastics
emphasized their recognition of the analogy by calling the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of an unconscious agent,—the principle of its active tendencies
towards the realization of its own perfection—an <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">appetitus
naturalis</span></span>”</span>: an expression into which no one familiar with scholastic
terminology would venture to read any element of mysticism.<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href="#note_505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">505</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every separate agency in nature has a uniform mode of
activity; by following out this line of action each co-operates
with all the others in maintaining the orderly course of nature.
These are facts which call for explanation. They are not explained
by the supposition of mechanists that these agencies are
mere efficient causes: efficient causality does not account for order,
it has got simply nothing to do with order or regularity. Consequently
the last word of the mechanical philosophy on the fact
of order in the universe is—Agnosticism. In opposition to this
attitude we are far from contending that there is no mystery, or
that all is clear either in regard to the fact of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em> or the fact
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regularity</span></em>. Just as we cannot explain everything in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em>
causality, so neither can we explain everything in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> causality.
But we do contend that the element of order, development,
evolution, even in the physical universe, can be partially explained
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by recognizing in its several agencies a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>, a principle
of development, a passive inclination implanted in the very being
of these agencies by the Intelligent Author of their being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In conscious agencies this inclination or tendency to actions
conformable or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">connatural</span></em> to their being is not always in act; it
is aroused by conscious cognition, perception, or imagination of
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>, and operates intermittently. In unconscious agencies it
is congenital and constantly in act, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> as a tendency, not as
actually operative: for its actual development due conditions of
environment are required: the seed will not grow without a suitable
soil, temperature, moisture, etc. In conscious agencies
the tendency, considered entitatively or as a reality in them, is an
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accidental form</span></em>; in unconscious agencies it is their <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span>,
the formative substantial principle, which determines
the specific type to which their nature belongs.<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href="#note_506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">506</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In all agencies the inclination or appetite or tendency to action
arises from a form; an elicited appetite from an <span class="tei tei-q">“intentional”</span>
form, a natural appetite from a <span class="tei tei-q">“natural”</span> form: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Omnis inclinatio
seu appetitus consequitur formam; appetitus elicitus formam intentionalem,

aphorism, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Omne agens agit propter finem</span></span>: Every agency acts for
an end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From our analysis of final causality it will be seen that the
<span class="tei tei-q">“end”</span> becomes a cause by exercising its influence on the agent
or efficient cause, and thus initiating the action of the latter. We
have seen already that material and formal causes exercise their
causality dependently on the efficient cause of the change or
effect produced by the latter. We now see that the final cause,
the end as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intended</span></em>, determines the action of the efficient cause;
hence its causality holds the primacy as compared with that of
the other causes: it is in this sense the cause of causes, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa
causarum</span></span>.<a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507" href="#note_507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">507</span></span></a> But while the end <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as intended</span></em> is the starting point of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the whole process, the end <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as attained</span></em> is the ultimate term of the
latter. Hence the scholastic aphorism: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Finis est primus in
intentione et ultimus in executione</span></span>. And this is true where the
process involves a series of acts attaining to means subordinate to
an end: this latter is the first thing intended and the last attained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The final cause, the end as intended, is extrinsic to the effect.
It is intrinsic to the efficient cause. It is a <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma</span></span>”</span> or determinative
principle of the latter: a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma intentionalis</span></span> in conscious

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such, then, is the teleological conception of the nature of each

constitute the whole physical universe; and furthermore in all
such contexts we usually understand by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> the world of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corporeal</span></em> things as distinct from the domain of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mind</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spirit</span></em>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The proof of this view,—that the agencies of the physical
universe are not merely efficient causes, but that they act under the
influence of ends; that they have definite lines of action which
are natural to them, and whereby they realize their own individual
development and the maintenance of the universe as a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>; that by doing so they reveal the influence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligent
purpose</span></em>,—the proof of this view lies, as we have seen, in the fact
that their activities are regular, uniform, and mutually useful, or,
in other words, that they are productive of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">order</span></em> (<a href="#Section_110" class="tei tei-ref">110</a>). Bearing
this in mind let us inquire into the various meanings discernible
in the very familiar expressions, <span class="tei tei-q">“laws of nature,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“physical laws,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“natural laws”</span>.<a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512" href="#note_512"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">512</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may understand firstly by a law of nature this innate
tendency we have been describing as impressed upon the very
being of all created things by the Creator. It is in this sense
we speak of a thing acting <span class="tei tei-q">“naturally,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“according to the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law</span></em> of its nature,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“according to its nature,”</span> when we see
it acting according to what we conceive to be the end intended
for it, acting in a manner conducive to the development of its
own individuality, the preservation of its specific type or kind,
and the fulfilment of its rôle in the general scheme of
things. What this <span class="tei tei-q">“natural”</span> mode of action is for this particular
kind of thing, we gather from our experience of the
regular or normal activity of things of its kind. Thus, we
say it is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law</span></em> of oxygen and hydrogen to combine in definite
proportions, under suitable conditions, to form water; a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law</span></em> of
all particles of matter in the universe to tend to move towards one
another with a definite acceleration; a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law</span></em> of living organisms to
reproduce their kind. This usage comes nearest to the original
meaning of the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law</span></em>: a precept or command imposed on
intelligent agents by a superior. For we conceive this natural
tendency impressed on physical agencies by the Creator after the
analogy of a precept or command. And we have good reason
to do so: because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">uniformity of conduct</span></em> in intelligent agents is
the normal result of their obedience to a law imposed upon them;
and we see in the activities of the physical universe an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all-pervading
feature of regularity</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, we transfer the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law</span></em> to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this result itself</span></em> of the
natural tendency of the being, of the convergence of its activities
towards its end. That is to say, we call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the uniform mode of
action</span></em> of an agent a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law of nature</span></em>, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical law</span></em>.
This usage, which is common in the positive sciences, implies a
less profound, a more superficial, but a perfectly legitimate mode
of apprehending and studying the changes and phenomena of the
physical universe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, since the several agencies of the universe co-exist in
time and space, since they constantly interact on one another,
since for the exercise of the natural activities of each <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certain
extrinsic conditions of relationship with its environment</span></em> must be
fulfilled, an accurate knowledge and exact formulation of these
relations are obviously requisite for a scientific and practical insight
into the mode of activity of any natural agency. In fact
the physical scientist may and does take for granted the natural
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tendency and the uniformity of action resulting therefrom, and
confines himself to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discovering and formulating the relations between
any given kind of action and the extrinsic conditions requisite for
its exercise</span></em>. Such, for instance, would be any chemical <span class="tei tei-q">“law”</span>
setting forth the measure, and the conditions of temperature,
pressure, etc., in which certain chemical elements combine to
form a certain chemical compound. To all such formulae scientists
give the title of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical laws</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">laws of physical nature</span></em>. These
formulae, descriptive of the manner in which a phenomenon takes
place, setting forth with the greatest possible quantitative exactness
the phenomenal factors<a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href="#note_513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">513</span></span></a> that enter into and precede and accompany
it, are laws in a still more superficial and still less philosophical
sense, but a sense which is most commonly—and justly—accepted
in the positive or physical sciences.

and the investigator who seeks for the ultimate real ground and explanation
of these latter by speculative analysis of them, and by reasoning from the
scientist's discoveries about them,—if it were understood and agreed that investigation
into the scope and significance and ultimate ground of this feature
of stability in the laws of physical nature belongs to the philosopher rather
than to the scientist. We have already called attention to the fact that the
propriety of such an obviously reasonable and intelligible division of labour is
almost universally admitted in theory both by scientists and by philosophers;
though, unfortunately, it is not always remembered in practice (</span><a href="#Section_100" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">100</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">).
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
In theory the scientist assumes, and very properly assumes, that the
agencies with which he deals are not capricious, unreliable, irregular, but
stable, reliable, regular in their mode of action, that in similar sets of conditions
and circumstances they will act uniformly. Without inquiring into
the ultimate grounds of this assumption he premises that all his conclusions,
all his inductive generalizations about the activity of these agencies, will hold
good of these latter just in so far as they do act according to his general
postulate as to their regularity. He then proceeds, by the inductive processes
of hypothesis and experimental verification, to determine what agencies
produce such or such an event, under what conditions they bring this about,
what are all the phenomenal conditions, positive and negative, antecedent and
concomitant, in the absence of any one of which this event will not happen,
and in the presence of all of which it will happen. These are, in accordance
with his assumption, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">determining</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> causes of the event; the knowledge of
them is from the speculative point of view extremely important, and from the
practical standpoint of invention and applied science extremely useful. As a
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg 420]</span><a name="Pg420" id="Pg420" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">

conditions and in what measure, water is produced from oxygen and hydrogen.
When he has discovered all these positive and negative conditions his </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">scientific</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
knowledge of the formation of water is complete.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
But there are other questions in regard to natural phenomena to which
the experimental methods of the positive sciences can offer no reply. They
can tell us nothing about the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">wider</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">how</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> which resolves itself into a </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">why.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">
They can give no information about the ultimate causes, origins, reasons, or
essences, of those phenomena. As Pasteur and other equally illustrious
scientists have proclaimed, experimental science is essentially positive, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> confined
to the proximate phenomenal conditions and causes of things; it has

and emphasizing even such obvious methodological considerations.
Bearing them in mind, let us now examine the uniformity and necessity of
the laws of physical nature.
</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Understanding by natural law the natural inclination or
tendency of the creature to a definite line of activity, this law is
of itself determining or necessitating. Moreover, it is absolutely
inseparable from the essence of the creature. Granted that the
creature exists, it has this tendency to exert and direct all its
forces and energies in a definite, normal way, for the realization
of its end. This <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nisus naturae</span></span> is never absent; it is observable
even where, as in the generation of <span class="tei tei-q">“monsters”</span> by living organisms,
it partially fails to attain its end. A law of nature, taken
in this sense, is absolutely necessary to, and inseparable from,
the created agent; it admits of no exceptions; no agent can exist
without it; for it is identical with the very being of the agent
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the uniformity of action resulting from this natural
tendency, the uniform series of normal operations whereby it
realizes its end, is not absolutely necessary, inviolable, unexceptional.
In the first place the Author of Nature can, for a
higher or moral purpose, prevent any created agency supernaturally,
miraculously, from actually exercising its active powers in
accordance with its nature for the prosecution of its natural end.
But apart altogether from this, abstracting from all special interference
of the First Cause, and confining our attention to the
natural order itself, we have to consider that for any physical
agency to act in its natural or normal manner certain extrinsic
conditions are always requisite: oxygen and hydrogen, for instance,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg 422]</span><a name="Pg422" id="Pg422" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will combine to produce water, but only under certain
conditions of contact, pressure, temperature, etc. This general
requirement arises from the fact already mentioned, that physical
agencies co-exist in time and space and are constantly interacting.
These extrinsic conditions are, of course, not expressly stated
in the formulation of those uniformities and quantitative descriptions
called <span class="tei tei-q">“laws of nature”</span> in the second and third interpretations
of this expression as explained above. It is taken as
understood that the law applies only if and when and where all
such conditions are verified. The law, therefore, as stated categorically,
does not express an absolutely necessary, universal,
and unexceptional truth. It may admit of exceptions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the next place, when we come to examine these exceptions
to uniformity, these failures or frustrations of the normal or
natural activities of physical agencies, we find it possible to distinguish
roughly, with Aristotle, between two groups of such
<span class="tei tei-q">“uniformities”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“laws”</span>. There are firstly those which, so far
as our experience goes, seem to prevail <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></em> (ἀεὶ), unexceptionally;
and secondly, those which seem to prevail <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generally</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the most part</span></em> (ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ), though not unexceptionally.
The former would be the outcome of active powers, energies,
forces, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> present and prevalent always and everywhere in
all physical agencies, and of such a character that the conditions
requisite for their actual operation would be always verified.
Such, for instance, would be the force of gravity in all ponderable
matter; and hence the law of gravitation is regarded as all-pervading,
universal, unexceptional. But there are other natural
or normal effects which are the outcome of powers, forces,
energies, not all-pervading, but restricted to special groups of
agencies, dependent for their actual production on the presence of
a great and complex variety of extrinsic conditions, and liable
therefore to be impeded by the interfering action of numerous
other natural agencies. Such, for instance, would be the
natural powers and processes whereby living organisms propagate
their kind. The law, therefore, which states it to be a uniformity
of nature that living organisms reproduce offspring similar to
themselves in kind, is a general law, admitting exceptions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Operations and effects which follow from the nature of their
causes are called natural (καθ᾽ ἁυτό, καὶ μὴ κατὰ συμβεβηκός).<a id="noteref_515" name="noteref_515" href="#note_515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">515</span></span></a>

things happening by <span class="tei tei-q">“chance,”</span> by (good or bad) <span class="tei tei-q">“luck”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“fortune”</span>.<a id="noteref_518" name="noteref_518" href="#note_518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">518</span></span></a> There are terms in all languages expressive of this
experience—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">casus</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sors</span></span>, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fortuna</span></span>, τύχη, etc. The notion underlying
all of them is that of something occurring unintentionally,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praeter intentionem agentis</span></span>. Whether chance effects result from
the action of intelligent agents or from the operation of physical
causes they are not <span class="tei tei-q">“intended,”</span>—by the deliberate purpose of
the intelligent agent in the one case, or by the natural tendency,
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">intentio naturae</span></span>, of the mere physical agency in the other.
Such an effect, therefore, has not a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></em> cause; hence it is
considered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exceptional</span></em>, and is always more or less unexpected.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Nature</span></em>, as Aristotle rightly observes,<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519" href="#note_519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">519</span></span></a> never produces a chance
effect. His meaning is, that whenever such an effect occurs it is
not brought about in accordance with the natural tendency of
any physical agency. It results from a collision or coincidence
of two or more such agencies, each acting according to its
nature. The hunter's act of firing at a wild fowl is an intentional
act. The boy's act of coming into the thicket to gather wild
flowers is an intentional act. The accidental shooting of the
boy is the result of a coincidence of the two intentional acts.
Similarly, each of all the various agencies which bring about the
development of an embryo in the maternal womb has its own
immediate and particular natural effect, and only mediately
contributes to the general effect of bringing the embryo to
maturity. As a rule these particular effects are favourable to the
general effect. But sometimes the immediate ends do not
subserve this ulterior purpose. The result is accidental, exceptional,
a deviation from the normal type, an anomaly, a
<span class="tei tei-q">“monster”</span> in the domain of living organisms.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a name="Pg424" id="Pg424" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Aristotle's analysis, correct so far, is incomplete. It assigns
no ultimate explanation of the fact that there are such encounters
of individual natural tendencies in the universe, such failures in
the subordination of particular ends to wider ulterior ends.
As a matter of fact these chance effects, although not <span class="tei tei-q">“intended”</span>
by the natures of individual created agencies, are not wholly and
entirely unintended. They are not wholly aimless. They enter
into the general plan and scheme of things as known and willed
by the Author of Nature. They are known to His Intelligence,
and willed and ruled by His Providence. For Him there can be
no such thing as chance. Effects that are accidental in relation
to created causes, effects that run counter to the nature or
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">intentio naturae</span></span> of these, are foreseen and willed by Him and
made to subserve that wider and more general end which is the
universal order of the world that He has actually willed to
create. It is only in relation to the natures of individual
agencies, and to the limited horizon of our finite intelligences,
that such phenomena can present the aspect of fortuitous or
chance occurrences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before passing on to deal, in our concluding section, with the
great fact of order, let us briefly compare with the foregoing explanation
of nature and its laws the attempt of mechanists
to explain these without recognizing in the physical universe any
influence of final causes, or any indication of a purposive intelligence.
We have ventured to describe their attitude as philosophic
fatalism.<a id="noteref_520" name="noteref_520" href="#note_520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">520</span></span></a> According to their view there is no ground for the distinction
between phenomena that happen <span class="tei tei-q">“naturally”</span> and phenomena
that happen <span class="tei tei-q">“accidentally”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“by chance”</span>. All alike
happen by the same kind of general necessity: the generation of
a <span class="tei tei-q">“monster”</span> is as <span class="tei tei-q">“natural”</span> as the generation of normal offspring;
the former, when it occurs, is just as inevitably the outcome
of the physical forces at work in the particular case as the
latter is the outcome of the particular set of efficient causes which
do actually produce the normal result: the only difference is that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the former, occurring less frequently and as the result of a rarer
and less known conjunction of <span class="tei tei-q">“physical”</span> causes than the latter,
is not expected by us to occur, and is consequently regarded,
when it does occur, as exceptional. Now it is quite true that
what we call <span class="tei tei-q">“chance”</span> effects, or <span class="tei tei-q">“exceptional”</span> effects, result
just as inevitably from the set of forces operative in their case, as
normal effects result from the forces operative in theirs. But this
leaves for explanation something which the mechanist cannot
explain. He regards a physical law merely as a generalization,
beyond experience, of some experienced uniformity; and he holds
that all our physical laws are provisional in the sense that a wider
and deeper knowledge of the actual conditions of interaction
among the physical forces of the universe would enable us to eliminate
exceptions—which are all apparent, not real—by restating
our laws in such a comprehensive way as to include all such cases.
We may, indeed, admit that our physical laws are open to revision
and restatement in this sense, and are <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> often modified
in this sense by the progress of science. But the important
point is this, that the mechanist does not admit the existence, in
physical agencies, of any law in the sense of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural inclination
towards an end</span></em>, or in any sense in which it would imply intelligence,
design, or purpose. On the contrary, claiming as he does
that all physical phenomena are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reducible to mechanical motions of
inert masses, atoms, or particles of matter in space</span></em>, he is obliged to
regard all physical agencies as being, so far as their nature is concerned,
wholly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indifferent</span></em> to any particular form of activity.<a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href="#note_521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a> Committed
to the indefensible view that all qualitative change is reducible
to quantitative (<a href="#Section_11" class="tei tei-ref">11</a>), and all material differences to differences
in the location of material particles and in the velocity and direction
of the spatial motion impressed upon each by others extrinsic
to itself, he has left himself no factors wherewith to explain the
actual order and course of the universe, other than the purely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indifferent</span></em>
factors of essentially or naturally homogeneous particles of
inert matter endowed with local motion. We emphasize this feature
of indifference; for the conception of an inert particle of matter subject
to mechanical motion impressed upon it from without, is the
very type of an indifferent agency. What such an entity will do,
whether or not it will move, with what velocity and in what direction
it will move—in a word, its entire conduct, its rôle in the universe,
the sum-total of its functions—nothing of all this is dependent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a name="Pg426" id="Pg426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on itself; everything depends on agencies extrinsic to it, and
on its extrinsic time-and-space relations to these agencies; and
these latter in turn are in the same condition as itself. Now is it
conceivable that agencies of this kind, of themselves absolutely indifferent
to any particular kind of effect, suitable or unsuitable,
regular or irregular, orderly or disorderly, could actually produce
and maintain the existing order of the universe? If they were
themselves <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">produced by an All-Wise and All-Powerful Being</span></em>, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">definitely arranged</span></em> in spatial relations to one another, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">initial
mechanical motion in definite directions and velocities</span></em> impressed on
the different parts of the system, there is no denying that Infinite
Wisdom and Power could, by Divine concurrence even with such
indifferent agencies, realize and maintain a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">orderly</span></em> universe.
Such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purely extrinsic finality</span></em> (<a href="#Section_106" class="tei tei-ref">106</a>) could, absolutely
speaking, account for the existence of order, uniformity, regularity,
system; though all the evidence furnished by the universe of our
actual experience points to the existence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic finality</span></em> also as
understood by Aristotle and the scholastics. But the mechanist
will not allow even extrinsic finality; he will not recognize in
the actual universe of our experience any evidence of a Ruling Intelligence
realizing a plan or design for an intelligent purpose;
he denies the necessity of the inference from the data of human
experience to the existence of a Guiding Intelligence. And what
are his alternatives? He may choose one or other of two.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He may restate in the more scientific and imposing terminology
of modern mechanics the crude conception of the ancient
Greek atomists: that the actual order of the universe is the
absolutely inevitable and fatal outcome of a certain collocation of
the moving masses of the physical universe, a collocation favourable
to order, a collocation which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">just happened to occur</span></em> by some happy
chance from the essentially aimless, purposeless, indifferent and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chaotic</span></em> motions of those material masses and particles. We say
<span class="tei tei-q">“chaotic,”</span> for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chaos</span></em> is the absence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">order</span></em> is the fact
that has got to be explained. In the concept of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indifferent, inert</span></em>
atoms of matter moving through space there is emphatically no
principle of order;<a id="noteref_522" name="noteref_522" href="#note_522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">522</span></span></a> and hence the mechanist who will not admit the
necessity of inferring an Intelligence to give these moving masses
or atoms the collocation <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">favourable to order</span></em> is forced to <span class="tei tei-q">“explain”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this supposed collocation by attributing it to pure chance—the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus fortuitus atomorum</span></span> of the ancient Greeks. When, however,
we reflect that the more numerous these atoms and the
more varied and complex their motions, the smaller is the chance
of a collocation favourable to order; that the atoms and motions
are supposed actually to surpass any assignable number; that
therefore the chance of any such favourable collocation occurring
is indefinitely smaller than any measurable proportion,—we can
draw our own conclusions about the value of such a speculation
as a rational <span class="tei tei-q">“explanation”</span> of the existing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>. And this
apart altogether from the consideration that the fact to be explained
is not merely the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">momentary</span></em> occurrence of an orderly
collocation, but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">maintenance</span></em> of an orderly system of cosmic
phenomena <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">throughout the lapse of all time</span></em>. No orderly finite
system of mechanical motions arranged by human skill can preserve
its orderly motions indefinitely without intelligent human
supervision: the neglected machine will get out of order, run
down, wear out, if left to itself; and we are asked to believe that
the whole universe is one vast machine which not only goes on
without intelligent supervision, but which actually made itself by
chance!<a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href="#note_523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">523</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Naturally such an <span class="tei tei-q">“explanation”</span> of the universe does not
commend itself to any man of serious thought, whatever his
difficulties may be against the argument from the fact of order
in the universe to the existence of an Intelligent Designer. Add
to this the consideration that the mechanist theory does not
even claim to account for the first origin of the universe: it
postulates the existence of matter in motion. In regard to this
supreme problem of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first origin</span></em> of the universe the attitude
of the mechanist is avowedly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agnostic</span></em>; and in view of what we
have just remarked about the <span class="tei tei-q">“chance”</span> theory as an <span class="tei tei-q">“explanation”</span>
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existing order</span></em> of the universe, it is no matter for
surprise that most mechanists reject this theory and embrace
the agnostic attitude in regard to this latter problem also.
Whether the agnostic attitude they assume be negative or positive,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> whether they are content to say that they themselves at least
fail to find any satisfactory rational explanation of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">origin</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>, or contend further that no rational solution

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have seen already (<a href="#Section_55" class="tei tei-ref">55</a>) that the apprehension of order
in things implies the recognition of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some unifying principle in
what is manifold</span></em>. What, in general, is the nature of this
principle? It is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">point of view</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">standpoint</span></em> from which the
unifying arrangement or disposition of the manifold is carried
out; in other words it is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purpose</span></em>, of the orderly
arrangement. The arrangement, and the order resulting from
it, will vary according to the end in view—whether, for instance,
it be an arrangement of books in a library, of pictures in a
gallery, of materials in an edifice, of parts in a machine. Hence
St. Thomas's definition of order as the due adaptation of means to

work of human intelligence the order realized is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">artificial</span></em>, when
it is the work of nature the order realized is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></em>. Art is an
extrinsic principle of order, nature implies indeed also an intelligent
extrinsic principle of order, but is itself an intrinsic
principle of order: the works of nature and those of art have this
feature in common, that they manifest adaptation of means to
ends.<a id="noteref_524" name="noteref_524" href="#note_524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">524</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subordination</span></em> of means to ends realizes an order which
has for its unifying principle the influence of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em>, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final
cause</span></em>. The group of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dynamic</span></em> relations thus revealed constitutes
what is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">teleological</span></em> order, the order of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purpose</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">finality</span></em>.
The realization or execution of such an order implies the simultaneous
existence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">co-ordinated</span></em> parts or members in a system, a
realized whole with complex, co-ordinated, orderly parts, the
principle of unity in this system being the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> of the whole.
This realized, disposed, or constituted order, is called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">esthetic</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg 429]</span><a name="Pg429" id="Pg429" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
order (<a href="#Section_55" class="tei tei-ref">55</a>), the order of co-ordination, composition, constitution.
In ultimate analysis, however, these two orders, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">teleological</span></em> and
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">esthetic</span></em>, having as respective unifying principles the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em>
cause and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> cause, are not two really distinct orders,
but rather two aspects of one and the same order: we have
seen that in the things of nature the intrinsic end or final cause
of each is identical with its <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span> or formal cause
(<a href="#Section_108" class="tei tei-ref">108</a>). But the final cause is naturally prior to the formal cause,
and consequently the teleological order is more fundamental
than the esthetic.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. Augustine's definition of order as <span class="tei tei-q">“the arrangement of
a multiplicity of things, similar and dissimilar, according its
proper place to each,”</span><a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href="#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a> reveals the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> cause of order in
the multiplicity of varied elements, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em> cause of order in
the group of relations resulting from the arrangement or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dispositio</span></span>,
and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> cause of order in the agent that disposes or
arranges them. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em> cause, though not directly mentioned,
is implied in the fact that the place of each factor in the system
is necessarily determined by the function it has to fulfil, the
part it is suited by its nature to play, in contributing to the
realization of the end or purpose of the arrangement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If, then, order is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the right arrangement or disposition of things
according to their destination, or in the mutual relations demanded
by their ends</span></em>, it necessarily follows that the very existence of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></em> order in the universe implies that this universe is not a
work of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chance</span></em> but a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purposive</span></em> work, just as the existence of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">artificial</span></em> order in products of human art implies that these
products are not the result of chance but of activity influenced by
final causes.<a id="noteref_526" name="noteref_526" href="#note_526"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">526</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is in fact impossible to conceive order except as resulting
from the influence of final causes. Right reason rejects as an
utterly inadequate explanation of the natural order of the universe
the fantastic and far-fetched supposition of a chance collocation
of indifferent, undetermined and aimless physical agencies.<a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href="#note_527"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">527</span></span></a> If
we find in the actual physical universe difficulties against the view
that this universe reveals the influence of final causes, such difficulties
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a name="Pg430" id="Pg430" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
do not arise from the fact that there is order in the universe,
but rather from the fact that with this order there seems to coexist
some degree of disorder also. In so far forth as there is
natural order there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cogent</span></em> evidence of the influence of final
causes. And so necessary is this inference that even one single
authentic instance of natural order in an otherwise chaotic universe
would oblige us to infer the existence and influence of a final
cause to account for that solitary instance. We mean by an
authentic instance one which evidences a real and sustained uniformity,
regularity, mutual co-ordination and subordination of
factors in the behaviour of any group of natural agencies; for we
allow that transient momentary collocations and concurrences of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indifferent</span></em> agencies, acting aimlessly and without purpose as a
matter of fact, might present to our minds, accustomed to seek
for orderly and purposive phenomena, the deceptive appearance
of order.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Order, then, we take it, necessarily implies the existence and
influence of final causes. This in turn, as we have already observed,
implies with equal necessity the existence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Intelligent Purpose</span></em>.
If, then, there is natural order in the universe, there must exist an
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Intelligent Will</span></em> to account for this natural order.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Leaving the development of this line of argument to its proper
place in Natural Theology, there remains the simple question of
fact: Is the physical universe a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>? Does it reveal order—a
natural order distinct from the artificial order realized by the
human mind in the mechanical and fine arts, an order, therefore,
realized not by the human mind but by some other mind, by the
Divine Mind? The evidences of such order superabound. We
have already referred to some of them (<a href="#Section_106" class="tei tei-ref">106</a>), nor is there any need
to labour the matter. Two points, however, in connexion with this
universally recognized fact of order in the universe, call for a
brief mention before we conclude. They are in the nature of
difficulties against the ordinary, reasonable view of the matter, the
view on which the theistic argument from order is based.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In accordance with the Kantian theory of knowledge it is
objected that the order which we apprehend, or think we apprehend,
in the universe, is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really in</span></em> the universe of our experience,
but is as it were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">projected into</span></em> this universe by our own minds in
the very process of cognition itself. It is therefore not real but
only apparent, not noumenal but only phenomenal. It is simply
a product of the categorizing, unifying, systematizing activity of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg 431]</span><a name="Pg431" id="Pg431" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
our minds. It is a feature of the phenomenon or mental product,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of the noumenal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">datum</span></em> as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invested with a category of thought</span></em>.
But whether or not it is a characteristic of the real universe itself
man's speculative reason is by its very constitution essentially
incapable of ever discovering. The theory of knowledge on
which this difficulty is based can be shown to be unsound and
erroneous. For a criticism of the theory we must refer the
reader to scholastic works on Epistemology. It may be observed,
however, apart from the merits or demerits of the theory, that
the experienced fact of order is by no means demolished or
explained away by any questions that may be raised about the
exact <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">location</span></em> of the fact, if we may so express it. Order is a fact,
an undeniable, experienced fact; and it looms just as large, and
cries out just as insistently for explanation, with whichever of
the imposing adjectives <span class="tei tei-q">“noumenal”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“phenomenal”</span> a
philosopher may choose to qualify it; nor do we diminish its
reality by calling it phenomenal one whit more than we increase
that reality by calling it noumenal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other difficulty arises from the existence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disorder</span></em> in
the universe. Pessimists of the type of Schopenhauer or
Nietzsche concentrate their attention so exclusively on the
evidences of disorder, the failures of adaptation of means to ends,
the defects and excesses, the prodigality and penury, the pain
and suffering, which abound in physical nature—not to speak of
moral evil,—that they become blind to all evidences of order, and
proclaim all belief in order an illusion.

is, however, the product of a morbid and distraught imagination
rather than a sane view of the facts. The undeniable existence
of disorder, of physical evils, defects, failures, frustrations
of natural tendency in the universe, does not obscure or
conceal from the normal, unbiassed mind the equally undeniable
evidences of a great and wide and generally prevailing order.
Nor does it conceal from such a mind the fact that the existence
of order in any measure or degree implies of necessity the existence
of plan or design, and therefore of intelligent purpose also.
Inferring from this fact of order the existence of a Supreme
Intelligence, and inferring by other lines of reasoning from the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a name="Pg432" id="Pg432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
data of experience the dependence of the universe on this Intelligence
as Creator, Conserver and Ruler, the theist is confronted
with the reality of moral and physical evil (<a href="#Section_52" class="tei tei-ref">52</a>), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disorder</span></em> in the
universe. But he does not see in this disorder anything essentially
incompatible with his established conclusion that the universe
is a finite creation of Infinite Wisdom, and a free manifestation
of the latter to man. If the actual universe is imperfect, he knows
that God created it freely and might have created a more perfect
or a less perfect one. Knowing that God is All-Powerful as He
is All-Wise, he knows that the actual universe, though imperfect
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em>, is perfect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relatively</span></em>, in that it infallibly reveals the
Divine Wisdom and Goodness exactly in the measure in which
God has willed to reveal Himself in His works. Conscious on
the one hand that his finite mind cannot trace in detail all the
purposes of God in nature, or assign to all individual events their
divinely appointed ends, he is confident on the other hand that
the whole universe is intelligible only as the working out of a
Divine plan, and not otherwise. To his mind as a theist these
lines are a clearer expression of rationally grounded optimism
than they were perhaps even to the poet who penned them:—

We have seen that the agencies which constitute the universal
order have each its own inner principle of finality; that these
agencies are not isolated but mutually related in such ways
that the ends of each subserve an extrinsic and remoter end which
is none other than this universal order whereby we recognize the
world as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmos</span></em>. The maintenance of this order is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intrinsic</span></em>
end of the universe as a whole: an end which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immanent</span></em> in

The immediate factors of the universal order of nature, themselves
devoid of intelligence, must therefore be the work of
Intelligent Will. To arrange these factors as parts of one harmonious
whole, as members of one orderly system, Supreme
Wisdom must have conceived the plan and chosen the means to
realize it. The manifestation of God's glory by the realization
of this plan, such is the ultimate transcendent end of the whole
created universe. <span class="tei tei-q">“The whole order of the universe,”</span> writes St.
Thomas, developing the thought of Aristotle,<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href="#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“is for the Prime

The truths so briefly outlined in this closing chapter on the
order and purpose of the universe have nowhere found more apt

poetic imagery than in these stanzas from the immortal epic of

<span class="tei tei-q">“Sapientis est ordinare. Cujus ratio est, quia sapientia est potissima perfectio rationis,
cujus proprium est cognoscere ordinem.... Ordo autem quadrupliciter ad rationem
comparatatur. Est enim quidam ordo quem ratio non facit, sed solum considerat,
sicut est ordo rerum naturalium. Alius autem est ordo, quem ratio considerando
facit in proprio actu, puta cum ordinat conceptus suos ad invicem, et signa conceptuum,
quae sunt voces significativae. Tertius autem est quem ratio considerando
facit in operationibus voluntatis. Quartus autem est ordo quem ratio considerando
facit in exterioribus rebus, quarum ipsa est causa, sicut in arca et domo. Et quia
consideratio rationis per habitum perficitur, secundum hos diversos ordines quos
proprie ratio considerat, sunt diversae scientiae. Nam ad <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophiam naturalem</span></em>
pertinet considerare ordinem rerum quem ratio humana considerat sed non facit;
ita quod sub naturali philosophia comprehendamus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">et metaphysicam</span></em>. Ordo autem
quem ratio considerando facit in proprio actu, pertinet ad <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rationalem philosophiam</span></em>,
cujus est considerare ordinem partium orationis ad invicem et ordinem principiorum

sense observation on the one hand and rational speculation on the other. This
sane view of the continuity of human knowledge, a view to which the Schoolmen of
the Middle Ages were ever faithful, was supplanted at the dawn of modern philosophy
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by the opposite view, which led to
a divorce between physics and metaphysics, and to a series of misunderstandings
which still prevail with equal detriment to science and philosophy alike.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_21" name="note_21" href="#noteref_21">21.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">De Wulf</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">History of Medieval Philosophy</span></span>, pp. 28-9, 66; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mercier</span></span>,

of the main conclusions and theories of the sciences that have an immediate bearing
on philosophy: chemistry, physics, geology, astronomy, mechanics, the axioms and

physiology of the nervous system, botany and zoology, political economy, sociology
and ethnology. Nowhere is the system of combining the scientific with the philosophical
formation of mind more thoroughly carried out at the present time than in
the curriculum of the Philosophical Institute at the University of Louvain. In the
College of Maynooth not only is the study of philosophy completed by a fuller
course of Christian Theology,—both disciplines thus combining to give the student
all the essential elements of a complete <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophy of Life</span></span> (ii.),—but it is preceded by

to philosophy (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Logique</span></span>, § 1, p. 6)—<span class="tei tei-q">“it was this feeling of individual impotence in
face of the task confronting the philosopher at the present day, that inspired the
foundation of the Philosophical Institute at the University of Louvain”</span>. He had
previously outlined the project in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rapport sur les études philosophiques</span></span> at the
Congress of Mechlin in 1891. Here are a few brief extracts from that memorable
document: <span class="tei tei-q">“Since individual effort feels itself well nigh powerless in the presence
of the field of observation which goes on widening day by day, association must
make up for the insufficiency of the isolated worker; men of analysis and men of
synthesis must come together and form, by their daily intercourse and united action,
an atmosphere suited to the harmonious development of science and philosophy alike....”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Man has multiplied his power of vision; he enters the world of the infinitely
small; he fixes his scrutinizing gaze upon regions where our most powerful
telescopes discern no limits. Physics and Chemistry progress with giant strides in
the study of the properties of matter and of the combinations of its elements.
Geology and Astronomy reconstruct the history of the origin and formation of our
planet. Biology and the natural sciences study the minute structure of living
organisms, their distribution in space and succession in time; and Embryology explores
their origin. The archæological, philological and social sciences reconstruct
the past ages of our history and civilizations. What an inexhaustible mine is here
to exploit, what regions to explore and materials to analyse and interpret; finally
what pioneers we must engage in the work if we are to have a share in garnering
those treasures!”</span></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_45" name="note_45" href="#noteref_45">45.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Grammar of Assent</span></span>, p. 229.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_46" name="note_46" href="#noteref_46">46.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Lucerna pedibus meis verbum tuum, et lumen semitis meis.—Ps. cxviii., 105.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_47" name="note_47" href="#noteref_47">47.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Tennyson</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In Memoriam</span></span>.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_48" name="note_48" href="#noteref_48">48.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Logic</span></span>, i., § 123.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_49" name="note_49" href="#noteref_49">49.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Logic</span></span>, i., pp. 204-6.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_50" name="note_50" href="#noteref_50">50.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Scotus</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Summa Theologica</span></span>, edit. by Montefortino (Rome, 1900), i., p. 106,

sense organs for the objects of its knowledge, should nevertheless have the
power to apprehend contingent realities apart from their contingent actual existence

truth of the proposition <span class="tei tei-q">“Two circles of equal diameters are equal,”</span> as an example
of the necessary, eternal, immutable characteristics of possible essences, goes so far
as to write (italics ours): <span class="tei tei-q">“What would happen, if, withdrawing all bodies, all
sensible representations, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and even all intelligences</span></em>, we should imagine absolute and
universal nothing? We see the truth of the proposition even on this supposition:
for it is impossible for us to hold it to be false. On every supposition, our understanding
sees a connection which it cannot destroy: the condition once established,
the result will infallibly follow.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“An absolutely necessary connection, founded neither on us, nor on the external
world, which exists before anything we can imagine, and subsists after we have
annihilated all by an effort of our understanding, must be based upon something, it
cannot have nothing for its origin: to say this would be to assert a necessary fact
without a sufficient reason.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is true that in the proposition now before us nothing real is affirmed, but if
we reflect carefully we find even here the greatest difficulty for those who deny a
real foundation to pure possibility. What is remarkable in this phenomenon, is
precisely this, that our understanding feels itself forced to give its assent to a proposition
which affirms an absolutely necessary connection <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without any relation to an
existing object</span></em>. It is conceivable that an intelligence affected by other beings may
know their nature and relations; but it is not so easy of comprehension how it can
discover their nature and relations in an absolutely necessary manner, when it
abstracts all existence, when the ground upon which the eyes of the understanding
are fixed, is the abyss of nothing.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We deceive ourselves when we imagine it possible to abstract all existence.
Even when we suppose our mind to have lost sight of every thing, a very easy supposition,
granting that we find in our consciousness the contingency of our being,
the understanding still perceives a possible order, and imagines it to be all occupied
with pure possibility, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">independent of a being upon which it is based</span></em>. We repeat, that
this is an illusion, which disappears so soon as we reflect upon it. In pure nothing,
nothing is possible; there are no relations, no connections of any kind; in nothing
there are no combinations, it is a ground upon which nothing can be pictured.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The objectivity of our ideas and the perception of necessary relations in a
possible order, reveal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a communication of our understanding with a being on which
is founded all possibility</span></em>. This possibility can be explained on no supposition
except that which makes the communication consist in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the action of God giving to
our mind faculties</span></em> perceptive of the necessary relation of certain ideas, based upon
necessary being, and representative of His infinite essence.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Balmes, therefore, does not mean that we could continue to see essences as
possible were we to imagine withdrawn not merely finite minds but even the Divine
Mind. In such an absurd hypothesis, nothing would appear true or false, possible
or impossible. But he contends that even when we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">try</span></em> to think away <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> minds,
even the Divine Mind, we still see possible essences to be possible. And from this
he argues that, since we have successfully thought away finite minds and the
actuality of essences, while the possibility of these latter still persists, these must be
grounded in the Mind of God, the Actual, Eternal, Necessary Being, where they
have eternal ideal being.

somewhat in this wise: If there were really different beings any two of them would

the absurdities of infinite number and infinite regress. A similar argument was
used by the medieval pantheist, David of Dinant, to identify God with the material
principle of corporeal reality: God and primary matter exist and do not differ;
therefore they are identical: for if they differed they should differ by something
distinct from either, and this again should differ from both by something distinct
from all three, and so on <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad infinitum</span></span>: which is absurd. Such sophisms arise from

or expressive of reality is a product determined by the influence of
reality (as active) on the mind (as passive); cognition as a vital process is active, a
reaction of mind to the influence of reality. It may be remarked, however, that
the cognitive process, as vital, has always a positive term. Our cognitive processes
are partly at least processes of abstracting, comparing, relating, universalizing:
processes which produce <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">intentiones logicas</span></span>”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entia rationis</span></span>,”</span> such

logical relations and logical distinctions: and hence arises the difficulty, when we
come to reflect on our cognitive experience, of discriminating between these
<span class="tei tei-q">“logical entities”</span> and the reality which we interpret by means of them: of
discriminating, in other words, between logical and real distinctions.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_156" name="note_156" href="#noteref_156">156.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">It is not necessary of course that this implicit embodiment of all the others,
by any one of them, be seen to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mutual</span></em>. It is sufficient, for instance, that of the
concepts <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span> be seen implicitly to involve <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span> to involve <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>, etc., though
not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>. However, it must be remarked that in the exercise of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thought</span></em> upon
its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstract</span></em> objects we feel something wanting to our intellectual insight as long as
the relations we apprehend are not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reciprocal</span></em>. In the sciences of abstract quantity
we approximate to the ideal of establishing reciprocal relations throughout the
whole system of the concepts analysed. But abstract thought does not give us an
adequate apprehension of the real: it represents reality only under the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">static</span></em> aspect,
and as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstract</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> apart from the individualizing conditions of time and space
which affect its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concrete, actual existence</span></em> as revealed in sense experience. Were we
to neglect the latter, and consider merely what abstract thought gives us, we should
regard as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really one</span></em> what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one for thought</span></em>. But what is one for thought is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
universal</span></em>; and the logical issue of holding the universal as such to be real is monism.
Or again, to put the matter in another way, in so far as intellect sees the objects of its
various abstract concepts to involve one another necessarily, it has no reason—as
long as it ignores the verdict of sense experience on the real manifoldness of actually
existing being—to abstain from attributing a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real unity</span></em> to the whole system of
abstract thought-objects which it contemplates as reciprocally and necessarily interrelated.
On the contrary, it should pronounce that whatever plurality can be unified
by the dialectically necessary relations discovered by thought, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really one</span></em>, and
must be regarded as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one reality</span></em>: which, again, is monism. But a philosophy which
thus ignores sense experience must be one-sided and misleading.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_157" name="note_157" href="#noteref_157">157.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Urraburu</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op. cit.</span></span>, Disp. ii., cap. ii., art. 5 (p. 319).</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_158" name="note_158" href="#noteref_158">158.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">infra</span></span>, <a href="#Section_83" class="tei tei-ref">§ 83</a>.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_159" name="note_159" href="#noteref_159">159.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Urraburu</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op. cit.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> p. 322.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_160" name="note_160" href="#noteref_160">160.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">St. Thomas</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Ente et Essentia</span></span>, cap. iv.: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ideo, si quaeratur utrum ista natura

to each other the transition to Spinozism was easy and obvious. If mind and
matter are so absolutely opposed as thought and extension, how can they unite to
form one human individual in man? If both are purely passive, and if God alone
puts into them their conscious states and their mechanical movements respectively,
what remains proper to each but a pure passivity that would really be common to
both? Would it not be more consistent then to refer this thought-essence or receptivity
of conscious activities, and this extension-essence or receptivity of
mechanical movements, to God as their proper source, to regard them as two attributes
of His unique and self-existent substance, and thus to regard God as substantially
immanent in all phenomena, and these as only different expressions of His
all-pervading essence? This is what Spinoza did; and his monism in one form or

<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse ad</span></span>”</span> as a reality independent of their own thought-activity. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cf.</span></span> art. by the present
writer in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish Theological Quarterly</span></span> (vol. vii., April, 1912: <span class="tei tei-q">“Reflections on
some Forms of Monism,”</span> pp. 167-8): <span class="tei tei-q">“The whole universe of direct experience
displays a unity of order or design which pervades it through and through; it is a
revelation of intelligent purpose. Now a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cosmos</span></em>, an orderly universe—which is intelligible
only as the expression of intelligent purpose, and not otherwise—is a system
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interrelated</span></em> factors. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relating</span></em> is unintelligible except as an expression of the
activity of mind or spirit, that is, of something at least analogous to our mental
activity of comparing and judging. Scholastic philosophers, as we know, discuss
the question whether or how far the exact object of our <span class="tei tei-q">‘relation’</span> concept is real;
that is, whether this object is, in itself and apart from the terms related [and the
foundation], a mere <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span>, a product of our thought, or whether it is in itself
something more than this; and some of them hold that there are relations which,
in themselves and formally as relations, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> something more than mere products of
our thought. Now if there be such relations, since they are not products of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em>
thought, we may fairly ask: Must they be the product of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> thought? And from
our analysis of our very notion of what a relation is, it would seem that they must be
in some sort or other a product or expression of some thought-activity: even relations
between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> things. It is in determining how precisely this is, or can be, that
the theist and the monist differ. The theist regards all material things, with their real
relations—and all our finite human minds, which apprehend the material world and its
relations and themselves and one another—as being indeed in a true sense terms or
objects of the Thought of God; not, however, as therefore identical or consubstantial
with the Divine Spirit, but as distinct from It though dependent on It: inasmuch as
he holds the Divine Thought to be creative, and regards all these things as its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">created</span></em>
terms. The kinship he detects between matter and spirit lies precisely in this, that
matter is for him a created term of the Divine Thought. For him too, therefore,
matter can have no existence except as a term of thought—the creative Thought of
God.”</span> Not that <span class="tei tei-q">“the intelligible relations apprehended by us in matter are ...
identical in reality with the thought-activity of the Divine Mind,”</span> as Ontologists
have taught [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">supra</span></span>, <a href="#Section_14" class="tei tei-ref">14</a>, <a href="#Section_18" class="tei tei-ref">18</a>, <a href="#Section_19" class="tei tei-ref">19</a>]; nor that we can directly infer the existence of a
Supreme Spirit from the existence of matter, as Berkeley tried to do by erroneously
regarding the latter merely as an essentially mind-dependent phenomenon; because
<span class="tei tei-q">“for the orthodox theist matter is in its own proper nature not spiritual, mental,
psychical; not anything after the manner of a thought-process, or endowed with the
spirit-mode of being”</span>. If predicamental relations, such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quality</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">similarity</span></em> of
material things, are, as those medieval scholastics contended, real entities, <span class="tei tei-q">“relative”</span>
in their nature, and really distinct from their extremes and foundations, did those
scholastics conceive such <span class="tei tei-q">“relative entities”</span> as essentially mind-dependent entities?
If they did they would probably have conceived them in the sense of Berkeley, as
created terms of the Divine Thought, rather than in the Ontologist sense which
would identify them with the Divine Thought itself. But it is not likely that they
conceived such relative entities as essentially thought-dependent, any more than
the absolute material realities related to one another by means of these relative
entities. On the other hand it is not easy to see how such relative entities can be
anything more than mere products of some thought-activity or other.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_420" name="note_420" href="#noteref_420">420.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">They rely especially on this text from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Potentia</span></span> (q. vii., art. 9): <span class="tei tei-q">“Relatio

a plurality of really distinct substantial forms can enter into the constitution of an

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em> according to their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural kinds</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Science of Logic</span></span>, i., § 67), these latter are
determined by the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formae substantiales</span></span> of the things classified, and are called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">infimæ
species</span></span>. Numerically distinct individuals which have (conceptually) the same <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma
substantialis</span></span>, fall into the same <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">infima species</span></span>; while if such individuals have (conceptually
and numerically) distinct <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formae substanialis</span></span> they fall into distinct <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">infimae
species</span></span> of some higher common genus. The wider the generic concept the
larger the group of individuals which it unifies: it is a principle of conceptual unity,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of universality. The objects of our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generic</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">differential</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specific</span></em> concepts,
throughout this process of classification, are only virtually distinct metaphysical
grades of being in the individuals. Now if the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span> which yields the
unifying concept of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">species infima</span></span> for the individuals, and the material principle
which is the ground of the numerical distinction between these latter, were likewise
regarded by the scholastics as being merely virtually distinct metaphysical grades
of being, in each individual, then the question of a plurality of really distinct forms
in one and the same individual would have no meaning: all <span class="tei tei-q">“forms”</span> in the latter
would be only virtually distinct from one another and from the material principle.
But the scholastics did not conceive that the real ground for grouping individuals
into <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">species infimae</span></span> was the same as that for grouping these latter into wider genera.
They regarded the relation between the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span> and the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materia prima</span></span> in
the individual as quite different from that between the generic and specific grades of
being in the individual (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">supra</span></span>, § <a href="#Section_38" class="tei tei-ref">38</a>; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Science of Logic</span></span>, i., § 44; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Joseph</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction
to Logic</span></span>, pp. 93-6). While they considered the latter a relation of virtual distinction
they held the former to be one of real distinction. And while they recognized
the concept of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">species infima</span></span> to be a principle of conceptual unity in grouping
the individuals together mentally, St. Thomas emphasized especially the rôle of
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span> (on which that concept was founded) as a principle of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quodlib.</span></span> i., art. 6). If we accept this doctrine of St. Thomas the arguments which

Induction does not indeed demand any inquiry either into the efficiency of natural

<span class="tei tei-q">“law”</span> whereby these are connected with their effects. But a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophical</span></em> theory of
Induction does imply such inquiries. And here phenomenist writers like Mill have
laid themselves open to two accusations. For while professing merely to abstract
from the problem of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficiency</span></em> they have tried equivalently to deny its existence by
proclaiming it superfluous and insoluble, besides consciously or unconsciously misrepresenting
it. And similarly, in dealing with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariability</span></em> of causal sequences in
the universe, with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em> character of its physical laws, they have misconceived
this necessity as being mechanical, fatal, absolutely inviolable; and have
wrongly proclaimed its ultimate grounds to be unknowable (Agnosticism). Cf. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">infra</span></span>,

eschewing the genuine Metaphysics, which seeks the real nature and causes of the
world of our experience, as superfluous and futile, they have substituted for it a
masked and spurious metaphysics which they have wrongly fathered on Physical
Science: a mass of more or less superficial speculations which have not even the
merit of consistency. No philosopher, starting with their views on the nature of the
human mind, can consistently claim for the latter any really valid or reliable knowledge
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">laws</span></em>, any more than of causes. For the knowledge of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law</span></em>, even as a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generalized</span></em> fact, is a knowledge that claims to pass beyond the limits of the individual's
present and remembered experiences. But there can be no rational justification,
whether psychological or ontological, for the certain reliability of such a step,
in the philosophy which logically reduces all certain knowledge to the mere awareness
of a flow of successive sensations supposed to constitute the total content of the
individual consciousness and the total reality of human experience.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_471" name="note_471" href="#noteref_471">471.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cf.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Maher</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Psychology</span></span>, ch. xvii., pp. 368-70.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mercier</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op. cit.</span></span>, § 229.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_472" name="note_472" href="#noteref_472">472.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-q">“When an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effort</span></em> of attention combines two ideas, when one billiard ball moves

activity is no doubt the most prominent type of efficient causality in our mental life.
But it is not the only type; we have direct conscious experience of intellectual
effort, of the work of the imagination, of the exercise of organic and muscular
energy. There is no warrant therefore for conceiving all efficient power or energy,
after the model of will-power, as Newman among others appears to have done
when he wrote in these terms: <span class="tei tei-q">“Starting, then, from experience, I consider a cause

do come ultimately from the effective will of God. This, however, is not a first
principle, but a remote philosophical conclusion.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_475" name="note_475" href="#noteref_475">475.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>, p. 66.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_476" name="note_476" href="#noteref_476">476.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">St. Thomas</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">QQ.
